            <p>The U.S. Alliance to End the Hitting of Children is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2011
              that brings together individuals, groups, and organizations to create a unified voice calling for, and
              working toward, an end to corporal punishment - an antiquated and dangerous form of disciplining a child -
              especially in schools and homes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Alliance, through education and legal means, seeks to end all social justifications and legal
              authorizations of corporal punishment. Achieving these goals will give children the same protection from
              this sort of physical violence that is already enjoyed by adults under state and federal law.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://stopspanking.org/">StopSanking.org.</a></h2>
              <p>To that end, StopSpanking, a nonprofit organization, is dedicated to ending corporal punishment of
                children. Our mission is to raise awareness of both parents and educators that spanking is violence and
                harms children. Spanking violates a child’s human right to be free from violence. There are strong
                Biblical arguments against the hitting of children. The research supports what we already know morally
                to be true, we should never hit children. The avalanche of research correlates spanking to a cascade of
                negative outcomes including increased aggression, mental illness, drug & alcohol abuse, and suicide, to
                name only a few.</p>
              <br>
              <p>We are seeking to advance a national campaign against spanking. As a professional community, many of us
                are unaware of the research and are failing to protect the public around this fundamental health
                concern. We know that spanking is the most prevalent risk factor for overt child abuse. Hitting children
                is on a continuum of violence against children, and is a gateway to criminal child abuse.</p>

                <p>NO HIT ZONE is a public awareness campaign that discourages the use of physical punishment

                  communities, and a wide variety of public health agencies have become “No Hit Zone” sites.</p>
