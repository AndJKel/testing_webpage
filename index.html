        </h2>
        <br>
        <p style="margin-left: 3%; color: #B9DBE5;">Spanking is the act of hitting a child, usually on the bottom, with
          the intent to deter future misbehavior.
          Increasingly, there is evidence to suggest that spanking children is harmful to their cognitive, emotional,
          and behavioral development – even well into adulthood. Further, research shows <b

            maltreatment</b>.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Corporal punishment, maternal warmth, and child adjustment: A longitudinal study in eight countries.</h3>
        <p class="article-details">Link: <a
            href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15374416.2014.893518">https://doi.org/10.1080/15374416.2014.893518</a></p>
        <p>Two key tasks facing parents across cultures are managing children's behaviors (and misbehaviors) and
          conveying love and affection. Previous research has found that corporal punishment generally is related to
          worse child adjustment, whereas parental warmth is related to better child adjustment. This study examined
          whether the association between corporal punishment and child adjustment problems (anxiety and aggression)
          is moderated by maternal warmth in a diverse set of countries that vary in a number of sociodemographic and
          psychological ways. Interviews were conducted with 7- to 10-year-old children (N = 1,196; 51% girls) and
          their mothers in 8 countries: China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines, Thailand, and the
          United States. Follow-up interviews were conducted 1 and 2 years later. <mark>Corporal punishment was related
            to
            increases, and maternal warmth was related to decreases, in children's anxiety and aggression over
            time</mark>;
          however, these associations varied somewhat across groups. Maternal warmth moderated the effect of corporal
          punishment in some countries, with increases in anxiety over time for children whose mothers were high in
          both warmth and corporal punishment. The findings illustrate the overall association between corporal
          punishment and child anxiety and aggression as well as patterns specific to particular countries. Results
          suggest that clinicians across countries should advise parents against using corporal punishment, even in
          the context of parent-child relationships that are otherwise warm, and should assist parents in finding
          other ways to manage children's behaviors.</p>

        <h3>Adverse childhood experiences and spanking have similar associations with early behavior problems.</h3>
        <p class="article-details">Link: <a
            href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2021.01.072">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2021.01.072</a></p>
        <p>Objectives: To examine whether adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and physical punishment (ie, spanking)
          are unique risk factors for behavior problems in early childhood, and whether ACEs moderate the associations
          of spanking with child behavior problems.
          <br>
          <br>
          Study design: We conducted prospective, longitudinal analyses on 2380 families in the Fragile Families and
          Child Wellbeing Study. Mothers reported outcomes of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems at age
          5 years; and the main predictors, ACEs and spanking, at age 3 years. ACEs included 9 items: physical abuse,
          emotional abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect, mother's exposure to intimate partner violence,
          parental mental health problem, parental substance use, parental incarceration, and parental death.
          Multilevel models examined the associations between ACEs, spanking, and behavior problems, and the
          moderating effect of ACEs in the associations of spanking with behavior problems. Analyses were adjusted for
          preexisting behavior problems, demographics, and neighborhood conditions.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: <mark>ACEs (β = 0.028; P < .001) and spanking (β=0.041; P < .001) at 3 years were unique risk factors
              for increased externalizing behavior problems at 5 years, after controlling for covariates.</mark> The
              magnitude of the
              associations of ACEs and spanking with externalizing behavior were statistically indistinguishable. ACEs
              did
              not moderate the association between spanking and externalizing behavior. <br>
              <br>
              Conclusions: ACEs and spanking have similar associations in predicting child externalizing behavior.
              Results support calls to consider physical punishment as a form of ACE. Our findings also underscore the
              importance of assessing exposure to ACEs and physical punishment among young children and providing
              appropriate intervention to children at risk.

        <p>Whether spanking is helpful or harmful to children continues to be the source of considerable debate among
          both researchers and the public. This article addresses 2 persistent issues, namely whether effect sizes for
          spanking are distinct from those for physical abuse, and whether effect sizes for spanking are robust to
          study design differences. Meta-analyses focused specifically on spanking were conducted on a total of 111
          unique effect sizes representing 160,927 children. Thirteen of 17 mean effect sizes were significantly
          different from zero and <mark>all indicated a link between spanking and increased risk for detrimental child
            outcomes</mark>. Effect sizes did not substantially differ between spanking and physical abuse or by study

        <h3>Attachment style and the association of spanking and child externalizing behavior.</h3>
        <p class="article-details">Link: <a

        <p>Objectives: To examine whether the longitudinal associations between maternal spanking and child
          externalizing behavior are moderated by attachment style.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: This study used data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (n = 2211), a large cohort
          sample of low-income urban families. Multiple-group autoregressive cross-lagged models examined the
          associations between maternal spanking and child externalizing behavior when children were ages 1, 3, and 5.
          Moderation by attachment style was examined using structural invariance testing. <br>
          <br>
          Results: For children with an insecure mother-child attachment style, <mark>spanking at age 1 was associated
            with
            externalizing behavior at age 3</mark>. However, for children with a secure mother-child attachment style,
          the
          association between maternal spanking at age 1 and child externalizing behavior at age 3 was absent.
          Attachment style did not moderate the association between maternal spanking at age 3 and externalizing
          behavior at age 5, suggesting that <mark>spanking at age 3 is associated with deleterious outcomes at age 5,
            regardless of attachment style</mark>. <br>
          <br>
          Conclusions: Results suggest that even in the context of a secure attachment style, spanking is associated
          with adverse outcomes in early childhood. Findings support the American Academy of Pediatrics 2018 policy
          statement, which encourages parents to avoid spanking when disciplining children. Results suggest that
          children, regardless of attachment style, may benefit from policies and services that promote non-violent
          forms of discipline.

        <p>Although the merits of parents using corporal punishment to discipline children have been argued for
          decades, a thorough understanding of whether and how corporal punishment affects children has not been
          reached. Toward this end, the author first presents the results of meta-analyses of the association between
          parental corporal punishment and 11 child behaviors and experiences. <mark>Parental corporal punishment was
            associated with all child constructs, including higher levels of immediate compliance and aggression and
            lower levels of moral internalization and mental health</mark>. The author then presents a process-context
          model to
          explain how parental corporal punishment might cause particular child outcomes and considers alternative
          explanations. The article concludes by identifying 7 major remaining issues for future research.</p>

        <p>This study examined the associations of 11 discipline techniques with children's aggressive and anxious
          behaviors in an international sample of mothers and children from 6 countries and determined whether any
          significant associations were moderated by mothers' and children's perceived normativeness of the
          techniques. Participants included 292 mothers and their 8- to 12-year-old children living in China, India,
          Italy, Kenya, Philippines, and Thailand. Parallel multilevel and fixed effects models revealed that
          <mark>mothers'
            use of corporal punishment, expressing disappointment, and yelling were significantly related to more child
            aggression symptoms</mark>, whereas giving a time-out, using corporal punishment, expressing disappointment,
          and
          shaming were significantly related to greater child anxiety symptoms. Some moderation of these associations
          was found for children's perceptions of normativeness.

        <h3>Strengthening causal estimates for links between spanking and children’s externalizing behavior problems.
        </h3>
        <p class="article-details">Link: <a
            href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797617729816">https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797617729816</a></p>
        <p>Establishing causal links when experiments are not feasible is an important challenge for psychology
          researchers. The question of whether parents' spanking causes children's externalizing behavior problems
          poses such a challenge because randomized experiments of spanking are unethical, and correlational studies
          cannot rule out potential selection factors. This study used propensity score matching based on the lifetime
          prevalence and recent incidence of spanking in a large and nationally representative sample (N = 12,112) as
          well as lagged dependent variables to get as close to causal estimates outside an experiment as possible.
          <mark>Whether children were spanked at the age of 5 years predicted increases in externalizing behavior
            problems
            by ages 6 and 8, even after the groups based on spanking prevalence or incidence were matched on a range of
            sociodemographic, family, and cultural characteristics and children's initial behavior problems</mark>.
          These
          statistically rigorous methods yield the conclusion that spanking predicts a deterioration of children's
          externalizing behavior over time.

          childhood experience.</h3>

            href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2017.01.014">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2017.01.014</a></p>
        <p>Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) such as child abuse are related to poor health outcomes. Spanking has
          indicated a similar association with health outcomes, but to date has not been considered an ACE. Physical
          and emotional abuse have been shown in previous research to correlate highly and may be similar in nature to
          spanking. To determine if spanking should be considered an ACE, this study aimed to examine 1): the grouping
          of spanking with physical and emotional abuse; and 2) if spanking has similar associations with poor adult
          health problems and accounts for additional model variance. Adult mental health problems included depressive
          affect, suicide attempts, moderate to heavy drinking, and street drug use. Data were from the CDC-Kaiser ACE
          study (N=8316, response rate=65%). <mark>Spanking loaded on the same factor as the physical and emotional
            abuse
            items</mark>. Additionally, <mark>spanking was associated with increased odds of suicide attempts (Adjusted
            Odds Ratios
            (AOR)=1.37; 95% CI=1.02 to1.86), moderate to heavy drinking (AOR)=1.23; 95% CI=1.07 to 1.41), and the use of
            street drugs (AOR)=1.32; 95% CI=1.4 to 1.52) in adulthood over and above experiencing physical and emotional
            abuse</mark>. This indicates spanking accounts for additional model variance and improves our understanding
          of
          these outcomes. Thus, spanking is empirically similar to physical and emotional abuse and including spanking
          with abuse adds to our understanding of these mental health problems. Spanking should also be considered an
          ACE and addressed in efforts to prevent violence.</p>

          increased child aggression between ages 1 and 5. Participants were 3,279 pairs of mothers and their children
          from a cohort study of urban families from 20 U.S. cities. Maternal spanking was assessed when the child was
          1 year, 3 years, and 5 years of age. Maternal warmth and child aggressive behavior were measured at 3 years
          and 5 years of age. Models controlled for demographic characteristics (measured at the child's birth), child
          emotionality (measured at age 1), and maternal psychosocial risk factors (measured when children were 3
          years old). Cross-lagged path models examined the within-time and longitudinal associations between spanking
          and child aggression. Results indicated that maternal <mark>spanking at age 1 was associated with higher
            levels of
            child aggression at age 3</mark>; similarly, maternal <mark>spanking at age 3 predicted increases in child
            aggression by
            age 5</mark>. Maternal warmth when children were 3 years old did not predict changes in child aggression
          between 3
          and 5 years old. Furthermore, maternal warmth did not moderate the association between spanking and
          increased child aggression over time. Beginning as early as age 1, maternal spanking is predictive of child
          behavior problems, and maternal warmth does not counteract the negative consequences of the use of spanking.

        <p>This study examined if, compared to White and African American children, maternal spanking of American
          Indian children was associated with child externalizing behavior problems. Using a community-based sample of
          3,632 children (1,183 White, 2,183 African American, 266 American Indian), multiple-group autoregressive
          cross-lagged models examined the associations between maternal spanking and child externalizing behavior
          across the first 5 years of life. Rates of spanking for American Indian and White children were similar at
          all three time points (age 1, age 3, and age 5). When comparing White and American Indian groups, maternal
          <mark>spanking at age 1 predicted child externalizing behavior at age 3</mark> (White: β = .10, p < .001;
            American Indian: β=.08, p < .01), and maternal <mark>spanking at age 3 predicted child externalizing
            behavior at age 5</mark> (White:
            β=.09, p < .05; American Indian: β=.08, p < .01). When comparing African American and American Indian
              groups, maternal <mark>spanking at age 1 predicted child externalizing behavior at age 3</mark> (African
              American: β=.08,
              p < .01; American Indian: β=.06, p < .001), and maternal <mark>spanking at age 3 predicted child
                externalizing
                behavior at age 5</mark> (African American: β=.08, p < .001; American Indian: β=.07, p < .001).
                  Structural invariance tests suggested that the associations observed among American Indian children
                  were not distinguishable from those observed among White and African American children. Results of
                  this study can be interpreted in light of the recent American Academy of Pediatrics statement that
                  encourages pediatricians to counsel parents against the use of physical punishment. Similar to White
                  and African American families, American Indian families may benefit from reducing or eliminating the
                  use of physical punishment.</p>

        <p>Spanking is one of the most common forms of child discipline used by parents around the world. Research on
          children in high-income countries has shown that parental spanking is associated with adverse child
          outcomes, yet less is known about how spanking is related to child well-being in low- and middle-income
          countries. This study uses data from 215,885 children in 62 countries from the fourth and fifth rounds of
          UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) to examine the relationship between spanking and child
          well-being. In this large international sample which includes data from nearly one-third of the world's
          countries, 43% of children were spanked, or resided in a household where another child was spanked, in the
          past month. Results from multilevel models show that reports of <mark>spanking of children in the household
            were
            associated with lower scores on a 3-item socioemotional development index among 3- and 4-year-old
            children</mark>.
          Country-level results from the multilevel model showed <mark>59 countries (95%) had a negative relationship
            between spanking and socioemotional development</mark> and 3 countries (5%) had a null relationship.
          <mark>Spanking was
            not associated with higher socioemotional development for children in any country</mark>. While the
          cross-sectional
          association between spanking and socioemotional development is small, findings suggest that spanking may be
          harmful for children on a more global scale than was previously known.

        <p>While corporal punishment is widely understood to have undesirable associations with children's behavior
          problems, there remains controversy as to whether such effects are consistent across different racial or
          ethnic groups. We employed a Bayesian regression analysis, which allows for the estimation of both
          similarities and differences across groups, to study whether there are differences in the relationship of
          corporal punishment and children's behavior problems using a diverse, urban sample of U.S. families (n =
          2653). There is some moderation of the relationship between corporal punishment and child behavior by race
          or ethnicity. However, <mark>corporal punishment is associated with increases in behavior problems for all
            children</mark>. Thus, our findings add evidence from a new analytical lens that <mark>corporal punishment
            is
            consistently linked to increased externalizing behavior across African American, White, or Hispanic
            children, even after earlier externalizing behavior is controlled for</mark>. Our findings suggest that
          corporal
          punishment has detrimental consequences for all children and that all parents, regardless of their racial or
          ethnic background, should be advised to use alternatives to corporal punishment.</p>

        <p>Objectives: To examine the relationship of corporal punishment with children's behavior problems while

        <h3>Slapping and spanking in childhood and its association with lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders
          in a general population sample.</h3>

        </p>
        <p>Background: Little information is available in Canada about the prevalence of and outcomes associated with
          a history of slapping and spanking in childhood. The objectives of this study were to estimate the
          prevalence of a history of slapping or spanking in a general population sample and to assess the relation
          between such a history and the lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: In this general population survey, a probability sample of 9953 residents of Ontario aged 15 years
          and older who participated in the Ontario Health Supplement was used to examine the prevalence of a history
          of slapping and spanking. A subgroup of this sample (n = 4888), which comprised people aged 15 to 64 years
          who did not report a history of physical or sexual abuse during childhood, was used to assess the relation
          between a history of slapping or spanking and the lifetime prevalence of 4 categories of psychiatric
          disorder. The measures included a self-administered questionnaire with a question about frequency of
          slapping and spanking during childhood, as well as an interviewer-administered questionnaire to measure
          psychiatric disorder.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: The majority of respondents indicated that they had been slapped or spanked, or both, by an adult
          during childhood "sometimes" (33.4%) or "rarely" (40.9%); 5.5% reported that this occurred "often." The
          remainder (20.2%) reported "never" experiencing these behaviours. Among the respondents without a history of
          physical or sexual abuse during childhood, <mark>those who reported being slapped or spanked "often" or
            "sometimes" had significantly higher lifetime rates of anxiety disorders (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.43, 95%
            confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.96), alcohol abuse or dependence (adjusted OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.27-3.21) and
            one or more externalizing problems (adjusted OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.36-3.16), compared with those who reported
            "never" being slapped or spanked</mark>. There was also an association between a history of slapping or
          spanking
          and major depression, but it was not statistically significant (adjusted OR 1.64, 95% CI 0.96-2.80).
          <br>
          <br>
          Interpretation: There appears to be a linear association between the frequency of slapping and spanking
          during childhood and a lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorder, alcohol abuse or dependence and
          externalizing problems.

        <p>The question of whether physical punishment is helpful or harmful to the development of children has been
          subject to hundreds of research studies over the past several decades. Yet whether causal conclusions can be
          drawn from this largely nonexperimental research and whether the conclusions generalize across contexts are
          issues that remain unresolved. In this article, the authors summarize the extent to which the empirical
          research on physical punishment meets accepted criteria for causal inference. They then review research
          demonstrating that physical punishment is linked with the same harms to children as is physical abuse and
          summarize the extant research that finds links between physical punishment and detrimental outcomes for
          children are consistent across cultural,family, and neighborhood contexts. The strength and consistency of
          <mark>the links between physical punishment and detrimental child outcomes lead the authors to recommend that
            parents should avoid physical punishment, psychologists should advise and advocate against it, and
            policymakers should develop means of educating the public about the harms of and alternatives to physical
            punishment.</mark>

          </a></p>
        <p>Objectives: Corporal punishment is still widely practiced around the globe, despite the large body of child
          development research that substantiates its short- and long-term consequences. Within this context, this
          paper examined the relationship between parental use of corporal punishment and youth externalizing behavior
          with a Chilean sample to add to the growing empirical evidence concerning the potential relationship between
          increased corporal punishment and undesirable youth outcomes across cultures.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: Analysis was based on 919 adolescents in Santiago, Chile. Descriptive and multivariate analyses
          were conducted to examine the extent to which parents’ use of corporal punishment and positive family
          measures were associated with youth externalizing behavior. Furthermore, the associations between
          self-reported externalizing behavior and infrequent, as well as frequent, use of corporal punishment were
          investigated to contribute to understanding how varying levels of parental use of corporal punishment were
          differently related to youth outcomes.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: Both mother’s and father’s <mark>use of corporal punishment were associated with greater youth
            externalizing behavior</mark>. Additionally, increases in positive parenting practices, such as parental
          warmth and
          family involvement, were met with decreases in youth externalizing behavior when controlling for youth
          demographics, family socioeconomic status, and parents’ use of corporal punishment. Finally, both infrequent
          and frequent use of corporal punishment were positively associated with higher youth problem behaviors,
          though frequent corporal punishment had a stronger relationship with externalizing behavior than did
          infrequent corporal punishment.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusions: Parental use of corporal punishment, even on an occasional basis, is associated with greater
          externalizing behavior for youth while a warm and involving family environment may protect youth from
          serious problem behaviors. Therefore, findings of this study add to the growing evidence concerning the
          negative consequences of corporal punishment for youth outcomes.

        <p>There is strong evidence of a positive association between corporal punishment and negative child outcomes,
          but previous studies have suggested that the manner in which parents implement corporal punishment moderates
          the effects of its use. This study investigated whether severity and justness in the use of corporal
          punishment moderate the associations between frequency of corporal punishment and child externalizing and
          internalizing behaviors. This question was examined using a multicultural sample from eight countries and
          two waves of data collected one year apart. Interviews were conducted with 998 children aged 7-10 years, and
          their mothers and fathers, from China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, Philippines, Thailand, and the United
          States. Mothers and fathers responded to questions on the frequency, severity, and justness of their use of
          corporal punishment; they also reported on the externalizing and internalizing behavior of their child.
          Children reported on their aggression. Multigroup path models revealed that across cultural groups, and as
          reported by mothers and fathers, <mark>there is a positive relation between the frequency of corporal
            punishment
            and externalizing child behaviors</mark>. Mother-reported severity and father-reported justness were
          associated
          with child-reported aggression. Neither severity nor justness moderated the relation between frequency of
          corporal punishment and child problem behavior. The null result suggests that more use of corporal
          punishment is harmful to children regardless of how it is implemented, but requires further substantiation
          as the study is unable to definitively conclude that there is no true interaction effect.</p>

          of
          children's acceptance of aggressive problem solving</mark>, above and beyond parental acceptance, parental
        experience
        of CP, and familial demographics.
        <br>
        <br>
        Conclusions: Findings supported an intergenerational cycle of violence; parents who experienced frequent
        corporal punishment during childhood perceived its use as acceptable and frequently spanked their children.
        These children, in turn, advocated that spanking be used as a disciplinary method and preferred aggressive
        conflict resolution strategies with peers and siblings. These findings support an additional “side effect of
        spanking;” when parents use CP it teaches their children that hitting is an acceptable means of dealing with
        conflict.
        <br>
        <br>
        Practice implications: Practitioners should encourage parents to avoid using CP as a disciplinary method which
        could lead to a change in the attitudes and behaviors of the next generation of parents.

        <p>Using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and
          Youth Development (Research Triangle Institute, 2002), this study examined the impact of corporal punishment
          (CP) on children's behavior problems. Longitudinal analyses were specified that controlled for covarying
          contextual and parenting variables and that partialed child effects. The results indicate that parental
          <mark>CP
            uniquely contributes to negative behavioral adjustment in children at both 36 months and at 1st grade, with
            the effects at the earlier age more pronounced in children with difficult temperaments</mark>. Parents and
          mental
          health professionals who work to modify children's negative behavior should be aware of the unique impact
          that CP likely plays in triggering and maintaining children's behavior problems. Broad-based family policies
          that reduce the use of this parenting behavior would potentially increase children's mental health and
          decrease the incidence of children's behavior problems.

          within-time and longitudinal associations between spanking and child aggression when the child was 1, 3, and
          5 years of age. Results indicated that mothers spanked more than fathers. When examining fathers only,
          fathers’ spanking was not associated with subsequent child aggression. When examining both parents
          concurrently, only mothers’ <mark>spanking was predictive of subsequent child aggression</mark>. We found no

        <p>A basic human right of all children is protection from physical punishment in all settings. Yet, corporal
          punishment remains common place within families, at home, at school, and elsewhere. In Thailand, cultural
          beliefs and values might preserve its use. This research sought to explore the use of corporal punishment in
          Thai homes. It also aimed to investigate young adult retrospective accounts of parent use of corporal
          punishment and their associations with psychological attributes and the acceptance of certain myths that
          might perpetuate its use. Two hundred and fifty young people (Mage = 20.26 years, SD = 1.19) recounted their
          parent’s disciplining strategies related to when they were 10 years old. They also completed the Personality
          Assessment Questionnaire (Rohner, 1999), the Corporal Punishment Myth Scale (Kish & Newcombe, 2015) and
          responded as parents to a number of child misbehavior scenarios. Overall, 80.4% reported some instance of
          corporal punishment as a 10-year-old with lifetime prevalence at 85.5%. <mark>Receiving corporal punishment

        <p>Corporal punishment and parental physical abuse often co-occur during upbringing, making it difficult to
          differentiate their selective impacts on psychological functioning. Associations between corporal punishment
          and a number of lifetime aggression indicators were examined in this study after efforts to control the
          potential influence of various forms of co-occurring maltreatment (parental physical abuse, childhood sexual
          abuse, sibling abuse, peer bullying, and observed parental violence). College students (N = 1,136) provided
          retrospective self-reports regarding their history of aggression and levels of exposure to childhood
          corporal punishment and maltreatment experiences. Analyses focused on three hypotheses: 1) The odds of
          experiencing childhood physical abuse would be higher among respondents reporting frequent corporal
          punishment during upbringing; 2) Corporal punishment scores would predict the criterion aggression indices
          after control of variance associated with childhood maltreatment; 3) Aggression scores would be higher among
          respondents classified in the moderate and elevated corporal punishment risk groups. Strong support was
          found for the first hypothesis since the odds of childhood physical abuse recollections were higher
          (OR = 65.3) among respondents who experienced frequent (>60 total disciplinary acts) corporal punishment
          during upbringing. Partial support was found for the second and third hypotheses. Dimensional and
          categorical <mark>corporal punishment scores were associated significantly with half of the criterion

        <p>The adverse effect of harsh corporal punishment on mental health and psychosocial functioning in children
          has been repeatedly suggested by studies in industrialized countries. Nevertheless, corporal punishment has
          remained common practice not only in many homes, but is also regularly practiced in schools, particularly in
          low-income countries, as a measure to maintain discipline. Proponents of corporal punishment have argued
          that the differences in culture and industrial development might also be reflected in a positive
          relationship between the use of corporal punishment and improving behavioral problems in low-income nations.
          In the present study we assessed the occurrence of corporal punishment at home and in school in Tanzanian
          primary school students. We also examined the association between corporal punishment and externalizing
          problems. The 409 children (52% boys) from grade 2 to 7 had a mean age of 10.49 (SD = 1.89) years. Nearly
          all children had experienced corporal punishment at some point during their lifetime both in family and
          school contexts. Half of the respondents reported having experienced corporal punishment within the last
          year from a family member. A multiple sequential regression analysis revealed that <mark>corporal punishment
            by
            parents or by caregivers was positively related to children's externalizing problems</mark>. The present
          study
          provides evidence that Tanzanian children of primary school age are frequently exposed to extreme levels of
          corporal punishment, with detrimental consequences for externalizing behavior. Our findings emphasize the
          need to inform parents, teachers and governmental organizations, especially in low-income countries, about
          the adverse consequences of using corporal punishment be it at home or at school.</p>

        <p>This study tested the hypothesis that corporal punishment (CP), such as spanking or slapping a child for
          purposes of correcting misbehavior, is associated with antisocial behavior (ASB) and impulsiveness by the
          child. The data were obtained through interviews with a probability sample of 933 mothers of children age
          2–14 in two small American cities. Analyses of variance found that the more CP experienced by the child, the
          greater the tendency for the child to engage in ASB and to act impulsively. These relationships hold even
          after controlling for family socioeconomic status, the age and sex of the child, nurturance by the mother,
          and the level of non-corporal interventions by the mother. There were also significant interaction effects
          of CP with impulsiveness by the mother. When CP was carried out impulsively, it was most strongly related to
          child impulsiveness and ASB; when CP was done when the mother was under control, the relationship to child
          behavior problems was reduced but still present. ln view of the fact that there is a high risk of losing
          control when engaged in CP, even by parents who are not usually impulsive, and the fact that impulsive CP is
          so strongly associated with child behavior problems, <mark>the results of this study suggest that CP is an
            important risk factor for children developing a pattern of impulsive and antisocial behavior which, in turn,

        <p>Corporal punishment in public schools is legal in nineteen states in the U.S. Over 100,000 students are
          disciplined with corporal punishment in public schools each year. Little is known about the forms school
          corporal punishment takes or about how school corporal punishment relates to students' outcomes. This study
          reports results from an anonymous online survey of emerging adults (ages 18 to 23) in the 19 states where
          school corporal punishment is legal. Of the more than 800 participants, 16% revealed that they experienced
          school corporal punishment. Propensity score matching was used to equate those who had experienced school
          corporal punishment and those who had not on a range of covariates. In regression models, having ever
          experienced school <mark>corporal punishment was linked with lower high school GPA, higher current depressive
            symptoms, and greater likelihood of spanking their own children in the future</mark>.</p>

        <p>This study investigated whether corporal punishment when the child was two years old predicted child
          externalizing behaviors a year later, and whether or not this association was moderated by parents' observed
          behavior towards their child. Data came from 218 couples and their first born child. The frequency of
          fathers' <mark>corporal punishment when the child was two years old predicted child externalizing behaviors a
            year
            later, while controlling for initial levels of child externalizing behaviors</mark>. Also, observed positive
          and
          harsh parenting moderated the relationship between corporal punishment and child externalizing behaviors.
          These results highlight the importance of continuing to examine the effects of a commonly used form of
          discipline (i.e., corporal punishment) and the parental climate in which it is used.</p>

        <p>This article addresses the impact of corporal punishment by parents on the psychological well-being of
          youth. The present research used the National Youth Victimization Prevention Study (NYVPS), a nationally
          representative sample of 1,042 boys and 958 girls, ages 10-16. Based on a stress-process framework, we
          examine: (a) the effects of frequency of corporal punishment experienced by youth ages 10-16 on
          psychological distress and clinically relevant depression and (b) the moderating influence of parental
          support on the associations between corporal punishment and psychological outcomes. Controlling for
          sociodemographic factors and physical abuse, <mark>our findings indicate a positive association between the
            frequency of corporal punishment and both psychological distress and depression</mark>. Although distress is
          greatest at higher frequencies of punishment, <mark>the association is also present at low and moderate levels
            of
            corporal punishment</mark>. An interaction between corporal punishment and parental support was also
          evident,
          showing that the impact of frequent punishment relative to no corporal punishment was greater in the context
          of high parental support.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Background: Findings are few and mixed regarding the moderating influence that supportive parenting might
          have on the link between corporal punishment and child depressive symptoms.
          <br>
          <br>
          Method: A multiple regression model was estimated to examine proposed relationships in a 1-year longitudinal
          community-recruited sample of 89 children (56% male; 9–12 years).
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: <mark>High levels of corporal punishment in tandem with high levels of supportive communication were
            associated with the highest levels of depressive symptoms</mark>.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusions: Although supportive parenting behaviors have been shown to be beneficial for child outcomes,
          when considering a stress-process framework, simultaneous experiences of harsh and positive parenting may
          yield more negative outcomes.

        <h3>Spanking by parents and subsequent antisocial behavior of children.</h3>

        </p>
        <p>Objective: To deal with the causal relationship between corporal punishment and antisocial behavior (ASB)
          by considering the level of ASB of the child at the start of the study.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: Data from interviews with a national sample of 807 mothers of children aged 6 to 9 years in the
          National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-Child Supplement. Analysis of variance was used to test the hypothesis
          that when parents use corporal punishment to correct ASB, it increases subsequent ASB. The analysis
          controlled for the level of ASB at the start of the study, family socio-economic status, sex of the child,
          and the extent to which the home provided emotional support and cognitive stimulation.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: Forty-four percent of the mothers reported spanking their children during the week prior to the
          study and they spanked them an average of 2.1 times that week. <mark>The more spanking at the start of the
            period,
            the higher the level of ASB 2 years later</mark>. The change is unlikely to be owing to the child's tendency
          toward
          ASB or to confounding with demographic characteristics or with parental deficiency in other key aspects of
          socialization because those variables were statistically controlled.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusions: When parents use corporal punishment to reduce ASB, the long-term effect tends to be the
          opposite. The findings suggest that if parents replace corporal punishment by nonviolent modes of
          discipline, it could reduce the risk of ASB among children and reduce the level of violence in American
          society.

        <p>Objectives: To examine the association between corporal punishment bans and youth violence at an
          international level.
          <br>
          <br>
          Design: Ecological study of low-income to high-income 88 countries.
          <br>
          <br>
          Setting: School-based health surveys of students.
          <br>
          <br>
          Participants: 403 604 adolescents.
          <br>
          <br>
          Interventions: National corporal punishment bans.
          <br>
          <br>
          Primary outcome measure: Age-standardised prevalence of frequent physical fighting (ie, 4+ episodes in the
          previous year) for male and female adolescents in each country.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: Frequent fighting was more common in males (9.9%, 95% CI 9.1% to 10.7%) than females (2.8%, 95% CI
          2.5% to 3.1%) and varied widely between countries, from 0.9% (95% CI 0.8% to 0.9%) in Costa Rican females to
          34.8% (95% CI 34.7 to 35.0) in Samoan males. Compared with 20 countries with no ban, the group of 30
          countries with full bans (in schools and in the home) experienced 69% the rate of fighting in males and 42%
          in females. Thirty-eight countries with partial bans (in schools but not in the home) experienced less
          fighting in females only (56% the rate found in countries without bans).
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusions: <mark>Country prohibition of corporal punishment is associated with less youth violence</mark>.
          Whether bans
          precipitated changes in child discipline or reflected a social milieu that inhibits youth violence remains
          unclear due to the study design and data limitations. However, these results support the hypothesis that
          societies that prohibit the use of corporal punishment are less violent for youth to grow up in than
          societies that have not.

        <p>This article examines violence by children against parents, with particular emphasis on violence against
          mothers. The data are from interviews with parents of a nationally representative sample of American
          children age 3 through 17 (N=l,023). Analyses of rates for the previous 12 months found that: (1) The
          younger the child, the higher the rate of child-to-parent violence (CPV). (2) At all ages, more children
          were violent to mothers than to fathers. (3) Both boys and girls hit mothers more than fathers. (4) At all
          ages, slightly more boys than girls hit parents. Tests of the theory that CPV reflects violence by the
          parents found that CPV was associated with violence by parents, regardless of whether the violence was
          husband- to-wife, wife-to-husband, corporal punishment, or physical abuse. In the absence of parent-to-
          child violence, CPV is rare. Because <mark>corporal punishment had the strongest relation to CPV</mark>, the
          findings
          suggest that steps to end violence against women cannot be limited to efforts to eliminate wife-beating, but
          should also include steps to end corporal punishment. Primary prevention is needed in the form of helping
          parents set an example of non-violence by not using corporal punishment.</p>

        <p>This study tested the hypothesis that the more prevalent the use of corporal punishment by parents in a

          was 56 percent (range 13-73 percent). The median rate of assaulting a dating partner was 30 percent (range
          15-47 percent), and of injuring a dating partner 7 percent (range = 1-20 percent). <mark>The results indicate

        <p>Objective: This study was undertaken to reveal the prevalence of corporal punishment in Alexandria and its’
          correlates with family background and child’s behavior and characteristics.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: A cross sectional survey targeting preparatory and secondary school children was conducted. The
          multistage random sample technique was adopted to select a representative sample of this population.
          Subjects were requested to complete a self-administered questionnaire to collect relevant information. Data
          were analyzed using the univariate and multivariate analyses.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: This study revealed that more than one-third (37.47%) of children were disciplined physically in
          the form of beating and a few were also burned or tied. In 25.83% of them, this <mark>harsh discipline led to
            physical injuries of variable degrees of severity amounting to fractures, loss of consciousness, and
            permanent disability</mark>. Predictive family background for the use of corporal punishment were: living in
          an
          apartment shared with strangers; high crowding index; constant fights and quarrels between family members;
          lack of regular relation with relatives and acquaintance as well as an income insufficient to meet the
          family basic needs. Predictive child’s characteristics and behavior included young age; disobedience;
          telling lies; destroying others’ belongings; acting disrespectfully to parents; communicating poorly with
          their parents; running away from home; and poor school achievement, in addition to other determinants.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusion: A proportion of children are subjected to extreme physical brutality amounting to abuse in a
          disciplinary context. Parents’ education and the establishment of effective parent-child communication are
          deemed essential to combat this phenomenon.

        </p>
        <p>Previous research has linked parental corporal punishment and children's problem behaviors, whereas little
          is known about the effects of fathers' corporal punishment. Moreover, stress-buffering model suggested that
          parenting practices that are characterized by acceptance, supportive and responsiveness such as inductive
          reasoning may buffer children against the negative impacts of stressful life events including parental
          corporal punishment. As such, the current research examined the potential moderating effects of fathers' and
          mothers' inductive reasoning on the associations between their corporal punishment and children's problem
          behaviors, and further explored whether the moderating effects of inductive reasoning would be more stronger
          in same gender dyads (i.e., mother & daughter, father & son) than in mixed gender dyads (i.e., mother & son,
          father & daughter) within Chinese families. The Chinese version of Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale
          (CTSPC), the parental inductive reasoning items from the Iowa Youth and Families Project, the Youth
          Self-Report (YSR) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were used as the main assessment tools. Utilizing
          a sample of 675 elementary school-age children and their parents, similar patterns of findings between same
          gender dyads and mixed gender dyads emerged. Both mothers' and fathers' <mark>corporal punishment were
            directly
            associated with children's problem behaviors</mark>, whereas their inductive reasoning failed to moderate
          these
          associations. Findings from the current study suggested that it may be difficult for positive parenting
          (e.g., inductive reasoning) to counteract the adverse effects that parental harsh discipline (e.g., corporal
          punishment) has on children adjustment, and it may be more meaningful for intervention programs to focus on
          decreasing both fathers' and mothers' harsh discipline.</p>

        <p>Previous research has focused primarily on corporal punishment as a cause and adolescents’ physical
          aggression as an outcome. However, there is a large gap in knowledge of the potentially bidirectional
          association and explanatory mechanism underlying the association between corporal punishment and physical
          aggression. The current study, using a longitudinal design across three time points (the fall semester of
          7th grade, the fall of 8th grade, and the fall of 9th grade), aimed to a) examine the reciprocal processes
          between corporal punishment and physical aggression, and b) explore whether deviant peer affiliation may
          explain such reciprocal connections. Only adolescents participating in all the three time points were
          included in this study, resulting in a final sample of 342 adolescents (175 boys, 167 girls) who completed
          questionnaires regarding corporal punishment, deviant peer affiliation, and aggression. Gender, age and
          socioeconomic status were controlled for in the analyses. Autoregressive cross-lagged models showed that the
          results did not support the direct reciprocal effect between corporal punishment and physical aggression
          among Chinese adolescents. <mark>A direct longitudinal link from corporal punishment to physical aggression
            was
            found</mark>, however, the inverse association was not significant. Moreover, regarding the longitudinal
          underlying
          process, in one direction, <mark>corporal punishment at 7th grade predicted higher levels of deviant peer
            affiliation at 8th grade</mark>. In turn, higher deviant peer affiliation at 8th grade predicted increased
          physical
          aggression at 9th grade. At the same time, in the other direction, adolescent physical aggression at 7th
          grade significantly predicted deviant peer affiliation at 8th grade. In turn, higher deviant peer
          affiliation at 8th grade predicted decreased corporal punishment at 9th grade. Identifying the direct and
          underlying reciprocal processes between corporal punishment and adolescent physical aggression has important
          implications for an integrative framework of theory and prevention.</p>

        <p>Previous research on corporal punishment (CP) has found associations between CP and detrimental child
          outcomes including depression, behavioural problems, and crime. Conversely, positive parenting has been
          found to foster positive child outcomes but, positive parenting does not ameliorate the negative effects of
          CP. To date, research has not examined how parents’ differential use of CP might be related to crime, while
          still controlling for positive parenting. The present study seeks to address the gaps in the CP literature
          by examining the effects of CP and positive parenting on criminality within the context of dyadic
          concordance types (DCTs). DCTs examine the behaviour of both parents in disciplining children with CP:
          father-only, mother-only, both, or neither parents. Using the large-scale, International Parenting Study

          children and adolescents' outcomes in Colombia using longitudinal data from a national sample (N = 5801).
          Matching techniques were used to improve balance in covariates between children and adolescents exposed and
          not exposed to physical punishment. Findings suggest that children and adolescents' <mark>exposure to physical
            punishment was linked to higher internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as lower prosocial
            behaviors and receptive vocabulary</mark>. These results highlight the importance of implementing
          legislation and
          interventions aimed at eliminating physical punishment in Colombia.</p>

        <p>This study examined the prevalence, predictors, and outcomes of spanking and verbal punishment in 2,573
          low-income White, African American, and Mexican American toddlers at ages 1, 2, and 3. Both spanking and
          verbal punishment varied by maternal race/ethnicity. Child fussiness at age 1 predicted spanking and verbal
          punishment at all 3 ages. Cross-lagged path analyses indicated that <mark>spanking (but not verbal punishment)
            at
            age 1 predicted child aggressive behavior problems at age 2 and lower Bayley mental development scores at
            age 3</mark>. Neither child aggressive behavior problems nor Bayley scores predicted later spanking or
          verbal
          punishment. In some instances, maternal race/ethnicity and/or emotional responsiveness moderated the effects
          of spanking and verbal punishment on child outcomes.</p>

        <p>This study employed fixed effects regression that controls for selection bias, omitted variables bias, and

          their mothers who participated in Wave 3 (2001–2003; child age 3) and Wave 4 (2003–2006; child age 5) of the
          FFCWS. Results indicated that higher rates of neighborhood crime and violence predicted higher levels of

        <p>OBJECTIVE: The goal was to examine the association between the use of corporal punishment (CP) against
          3-year-old children and subsequent aggressive behavior among those children.
          <br>
          <br>
          METHODS: Respondents (N = 2461) participated in the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study (1998–2005),
          a population-based, birth cohort study of children born in 20 large US cities. Maternal reports of CP,
          children's aggressive behaviors at 3 and 5 years of age, and a host of key demographic features and
          potential confounding factors, including maternal child physical maltreatment, psychological maltreatment,
          and neglect, intimate partner aggression victimization, stress, depression, substance use, and consideration
          of abortion, were assessed.
          <br>
          <br>
          RESULTS: <mark>Frequent use of CP (ie, mother's use of spanking more than twice in the previous month) when
            the
            child was 3 years of age was associated with increased risk for higher levels of child aggression when the
            child was 5 years of age (adjusted odds ratio: 1.49 [95% confidence interval: 1.2–1.8]; P < .0001), even
              with controlling for the child's level of aggression at age 3 and the aforementioned potential confounding
              factors and key demographic features.</mark> <br>
              <br>
              CONCLUSIONS: Despite American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations to the contrary, most parents in the
              United States approve of and have used CP as a form of child discipline. The current findings suggest that
              even minor forms of CP, such as spanking, increase risk for increased child aggressive behavior.
              Importantly, these findings cannot be attributed to possible confounding effects of a host of other
              maternal parenting risk factors.

        <p>Many parents believe that spanking is an effective way to promote children's positive behavior, yet few
          studies have examined spanking and the development of social competence. Using information from 3,279
          families with young children who participated in a longitudinal study of urban families, this study tested
          competing hypotheses regarding whether maternal spanking or maternal warmth predicted increased social
          competence and decreased child aggression over time and which parent behavior was a stronger predictor of
          these changes. The frequency of maternal spanking was unrelated to maternal warmth. Findings from
          cross-lagged path models indicated that spanking was not associated with children's social competence, but
          <mark>spanking predicted increases in child aggression</mark>. Conversely, maternal warmth predicted
          children's greater
          social competence but was not associated with aggression. Warmth was a significantly stronger predictor of
          children's social competence than spanking, suggesting that warmth may be a more effective way to promote
          children's social competence than spanking.

        <h3>The relationships between harsh physical punishment and child maltreatment in childhood and intimate

        <p>Background: Physical punishment of children is an important public health concern. Yet, few studies have
          examined how physical punishment is related to other types of child maltreatment and violence across the
          lifespan. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to examine if harsh physical punishment (i.e.,
          being pushed, grabbed, shoved, hit, and/or slapped without causing marks, bruises, or injury) is associated
          with an increased likelihood of more severe childhood maltreatment (i.e., physical abuse, emotional abuse,
          sexual abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect, and exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV)) in
          childhood and perpetration or victimization of IPV in adulthood.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: Data were drawn from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions collected
          in 2004 to 2005 (n = 34,402, response rate = 86.7%), a representative United States adult sample.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: <mark>Harsh physical punishment was associated with increased odds of childhood maltreatment,
            including
            emotional abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect, and exposure to IPV
            after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, family history of dysfunction, and other child maltreatment
            types (range 1.6 to 26.6). Harsh physical punishment was also related to increased odds of experiencing IPV
            in adulthood (range 1.4 to 1.7).</mark>
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusions: It is important for parents and professionals working with children to be aware that pushing,
          grabbing, shoving, hitting, or slapping children may increase the likelihood of emotional abuse, sexual
          abuse, physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect, and exposure to IPV in childhood and also
          experiencing IPV victimization and/or perpetration in later adulthood.

        <h3>School corporal punishment, family tension, and students’ internalizing problems: Evidence from India.

        <p>There is considerable evidence that parental corporal punishment (CP) is positively associated with
          children’s behavioral and mental health problems. However, there is very little evidence addressing whether
          CP perpetrated by teachers or school staff is similarly associated with problematic student functioning. To
          address this gap in the research literature, data were collected from students in a locale where school CP
          continues to be widely practiced. Participants were 519 adolescents attending public or private schools in
          Puducherry, a city in eastern India. Students completed surveys assessing school CP, internalizing problems,
          social support, and resilience. The results indicated that 62% of the students reported experiencing school
          CP in the past 12 months, with males and those attending public schools being significantly more likely to
          report school CP than females and those in private schools. <mark>Youth who reported school CP reported more
            anxiety and depression</mark>. That relation was more pronounced in youth who reported family tension.
          Social
          support and resilience did not moderate the relations. The findings add to the substantial evidence about
          negative associations regarding the use of CP but in a new venue—the school, and provide some evidence for
          the need to change how students are disciplined in schools in India and elsewhere.</p>

        <p>This study examined how a range of physical punishment measures, ranging from mild corporal punishment to
          physical abuse, are associated with cognitive performance, school engagement, and peer isolation over a 3-
          year span among 658 children initially observed between the ages of 8 and 14. Physical punishment was
          captured in three groups: mild corporal punishment, harsh corporal punishment, and physical abuse, and both
          caregiver- and child-reported punishment measures were considered. After accounting for socioeconomic and
          demographic characteristics, only initial exposure to physical abuse was significantly associated with
          declines in cognitive performance. However, <mark>all forms of physical punishment were associated with
            declines
            in school engagement</mark>, and <mark>harsh corporal punishment was associated with increased peer
            isolation</mark>. Our
          findings were relatively consistent regardless of whether physical punishment was reported by the child or
          caregiver. Overall, our findings suggest that the prevention of physical abuse may enhance children's
          cognitive performance, but that alone may not be sufficient to ensure children are engaged and well-adjusted
          in school.</p>

        <p>Objectives: Physical punishment, as a means of disciplining children, may be considered a mild form of
          childhood adversity. Although many outcomes of physical punishment have been investigated, little attention
          has been given to the impact of physical punishment on later adult psychopathology. Also, it has been stated
          that physical punishment by a loving parent is not associated with negative outcomes; however, this theory
          has not been empirically tested with regard to psychiatric disorders. The main objective of the present
          study was to investigate three categories of increasing severity of childhood adversity (no physical
          punishment or abuse, physical punishment only, and child abuse) to examine whether the childhood experience
          of physical punishment alone was associated with adult psychopathology, after adjusting for sociodemographic
          variables and parental bonding dimensions.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: Data were drawn from the nationally representative National Comorbidity Survey (NCS, n = 5,877; age
          15–54 years; response rate 82.4%). Binary logistic and multinomial logistic regression models were used to
          determine the odds of experiencing psychiatric disorders.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: <mark>Physical punishment was associated with increased odds of major depression (AOR = 1.22; 95% CI
            =
            1.01–1.48), alcohol abuse/dependence (AOR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.08–1.61), and externalizing problems (AOR =
            1.30; 95% CI = 1.05–1.60) in adulthood after adjusting for sociodemographic variables and parental bonding
            dimensions</mark>. Individuals experiencing physical punishment only were at increased odds of adult
          psychopathology compared to those experiencing no physical punishment/abuse and at decreased odds when
          compared to those who were abused.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusions: Physical punishment is a mild form of childhood adversity that shows an association with adult
          psychopathology.

        <p>OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of maternal and paternal spanking of children at 3 and 5 years of age
          and the associations between spanking and children’s externalizing behavior and receptive vocabulary through
          age 9.
          <br>
          <br>
          METHODS: The Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study, a longitudinal birth cohort study of children in
          20 medium to large US cities, was used. Parental reports of spanking were assessed at age 3 and 5, along
          with child externalizing behavior and receptive vocabulary at age 9 (N = 1933). The data set also included
          an extensive set of child and family controls (including earlier measures of the child outcomes).
          <br>
          <br>
          RESULTS: Overall, 57% of mothers and 40% of fathers engaged in spanking when children were age 3, and 52% of
          mothers and 33% of fathers engaged in spanking at age 5. Maternal <mark>spanking at age 5, even at low levels,
            was
            associated with higher levels of child externalizing behavior at age 9, even after an array of risks and
            earlier child behavior were controlled for</mark>. Father’s <mark>high-frequency spanking at age 5 was
            associated with
            lower child receptive vocabulary scores at age 9</mark>.
          <br>
          <br>
          CONCLUSIONS: Spanking remains a typical rearing experience for American children. These results demonstrate
          negative effects of spanking on child behavioral and cognitive development in a longitudinal sample from
          birth through 9 years of age.

        <p>The authors tested a series of models linking spanking and child social-emotional outcomes using a sample
          of 3,870 families from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study. Spanking was measured by the number
          of times the focal child was spanked by the mother at ages 1, 3, and 5. Internalizing and externalizing
          symptoms were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist at ages 3 and 5. Child emotionality was used to
          index child behavior at age 1. A series of nested transactional and cascade models was tested through
          structural equation modeling. The final model supported <mark>transactional effects between spanking and child
            externalizing behaviors over child ages 1, 3, and 5</mark>. In addition, one cascade effect was found:
          <mark>Spanking at
            age 1 was related to greater externalizing behavior at age 3, which was related to greater internalizing
            behavior at age 5</mark>. Implications for family theory and future research are discussed.

        <h3>Harsh physical punishment in childhood and adult physical health.</h3>
        <p class="article-details">Link: <a
            href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-4021">https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-4021</a></p>
        <p>BACKGROUND: The use of physical punishment is controversial. No studies have comprehensively examined the
          relationship between physical punishment and several physical health conditions in a nationally
          representative sample. The current study investigated possible associations between harsh physical
          punishment (ie, pushing, grabbing, shoving, slapping, and hitting) in the absence of more severe child
          maltreatment (ie, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect, and
          exposure to intimate partner violence) and several physical health conditions.
          <br>
          <br>
          METHODS: Data were from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions collected in
          2004 and 2005 (n = 34 226 in the current analysis). The survey was conducted with a representative US adult
          population sample (20 years or older). Eight past year physical health condition categories were assessed.
          Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables, family history of dysfunction, and Axis I and II mental
          disorders.
          <br>
          <br>
          RESULTS: <mark>Harsh physical punishment was associated with higher odds of cardiovascular disease (borderline
            significance), arthritis, and obesity after adjusting for sociodemographic variables, family history of
            dysfunction, and Axis I and II mental disorders (adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.20 to 1.30).</mark>
          <br>
          <br>
          CONCLUSIONS: Harsh physical punishment in the absence of child maltreatment is associated with some physical
          health conditions in a general population sample. These findings inform the ongoing debate around the use of
          physical punishment and provide evidence that harsh physical punishment independent of child maltreatment is
          associated with a higher likelihood of physical health conditions.

          Importance: Inquiry into what childhood experiences are associated with antisocial behaviors in adulthood is
          necessary for prioritizing and informing efforts for effective prevention.
          <br>
          <br>
          Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study using data on the general US population obtained
          from the National Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions Wave 3 from April 2012 to June 2013. Participants
          were civilian, noninstitutionalized adults 18 years and older. This study used a multistage probability
          sampling design (response rate, 60.1%). Data were analyzed from January 25 to November 27, 2018.
          <br>
          <br>
          Exposures: Harsh physical punishment included pushing, grabbing, shoving, slapping, and hitting. Child
          maltreatment included physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect,
          and exposure to intimate partner violence.
          <br>
          <br>
          Main Outcomes or Measures: Lifetime antisocial personality disorder behaviors since age 15 years were
          assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-5 based on Diagnostic
          and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: The number of study participants was 36 309, with 15 862 men (weighted percentage, 48.1%) and 20
          447 women (weighted percentage, 51.9%); mean (SE) age was 46.54 (0.19) years. The prevalence of harsh
          physical punishment and child maltreatment was 18.1% and 46.7%, respectively. <mark>Harsh physical punishment
            only
            (adjusted β, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50-0.75), child maltreatment only (adjusted β, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.60-0.69), and
            harsh physical punishment and child maltreatment (adjusted β, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.38-1.54) were associated with
            adult antisocial behaviors</mark>. It is estimated that harsh physical punishment and/or child maltreatment
          might
          account for approximately 45.5% of antisocial behaviors among men in the United States and 47.3% antisocial
          behaviors among women in the United States.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusions and Relevance: Harsh physical punishment and child maltreatment appear to be associated with
          adult antisocial behaviors. Preventing harsh physical punishment and child maltreatment in childhood may
          reduce antisocial behaviors among adults in the United States.

        </p>
        <p>Background: A large body of research has found that corporal punishment is associated with increases in
          children’s behavior problems. However, questions remain as to whether or not the relationship between
          corporal punishment and behavior problems is equally true across contexts.
          <br>
          <br>
          Objective: To examine the degree to which the effects of corporal punishment are equivalent across
          neighborhoods. Specifically, is corporal punishment equivalently associated with child behavior problems in
          neighborhoods that are perceived to be unsafe or disadvantaged, as compared to neighborhoods that are
          perceived to be less disadvantaged?
          <br>
          <br>
          Participants: 2703 participants in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: We employed Bayesian regression methods, to examine the association of neighborhood disadvantage,
          corporal punishment, and their interaction, with child behavior problems.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: Findings suggest that both neighborhood disadvantage (β = 0.070) and <mark>parental use of corporal
            punishment (β = 0.169) had main effect associations with child behavior</mark>. However, there was no
          evidence for
          an interaction of neighborhood disadvantage and corporal punishment use.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusions: Both corporal punishment and neighborhood disadvantage were associated with increases in child
          behavior problems. Corporal punishment appears to be equally deleterious across neighborhood contexts.

        <p>Objective. To explore the relationship of spanking frequency before age 2 with behavior problems near time
          of entry into school.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods. Children who were younger than 2 years were followed up ∼4 years later, after they had entered
          school. The likelihood of significant behavior problems at follow-up was estimated in multivariate analyses
          that controlled for baseline spanking frequency and other characteristics. Participants were mothers from a
          large-scale national study and their children. Statistical analysis included an ethnically diverse sample of
          1966 children aged 0 to 23 months at baseline. Two dichotomous indicators of behavior problems were used.
          The first indicated that maternal rating of child behavior problems exceeded a threshold. The second
          indicated that a mother met with a school administrator to discuss her child's behavior problems.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results. White non-Hispanic <mark>children who were spanked more frequently before age 2 were substantially
            more
            likely to have behavior problems after entry into school, controlling for other factors</mark>. For Hispanic
          and
          black children, associations between spanking frequency and behavior problems were not statistically
          significant and were not consistent across outcome measures.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusion. Among white non-Hispanic children but not among black and Hispanic children, spanking frequency
          before age 2 is significantly and positively associated with child behavior problems at school age. These
          findings are consistent with those reported in studies of children older than 2 years but extend these
          findings to children who are spanked beginning at a relatively early age.

        <p>Despite considerable research, the relationship between corporal punishment and antisocial behavior is

          antisocial behavior and changes in antisocial behavior, (c) differences in the relationship of corporal
          punishment and antisocial behavior by race, and (d) whether this relationship could be accounted for by
          unmeasured characteristics of children and their families. Data from 6,912 children in the National
          Longitudinal Survey of Youth were analyzed using hierarchical linear models. <mark>Findings suggested that
            corporal punishment has a relationship with children’s initial antisocial behavior and with changes in
            antisocial behavior</mark>. No evidence was found for differences in the effect of corporal punishment
          across
          racial groups. <mark>The relationship between corporal punishment and antisocial behavior persists even when
            accounting for unmeasured time invariant characteristics of children and families</mark>. The findings
          suggest that
          corporal punishment is not a preferable technique for disciplining children.</p>

        <p>Using data collected over a 6-year period on a sample of 1,039 European American children, 550 African
          American children, and 401 Hispanic children from the children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,
          this study assessed whether maternal emotional support of the child moderates the relation between spanking
          and behavior problems. Children were 4–5 years of age in the first of 4 waves of data used (1988, 1990,
          1992, 1994). At each wave, mothers reported their use of spanking and rated their children's behavior
          problems. Maternal emotional support of the child was based on interviewer observations conducted as part of
          the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment. For each of the 3 racial-ethnic groups,
          <mark>spanking
            predicted an increase in the level of problem behavior over time, controlling for income-needs ratio and
            maternal emotional support</mark>. Maternal emotional support moderated the link between spanking and
          problem
          behavior. Spanking was associated with an increase in behavior problems over time in the context of low
          levels of emotional support, but not in the context of high levels of emotional support. This pattern held
          for all 3 racial-ethnic groups.

        <p>Whether spanking is detrimental for social-emotional (SE) development remains controversial, mostly due to
          disputes around the internal and external validity of existing evidence. This study examined the effect of
          spanking on the SE development of Bhutanese children, using a national, longitudinal sample (N = 1377; Mage
          = 50.5 months old; 50% girls). Following best-practice recommendations for mitigating issues of selection
          bias in observational developmental research, the study employed conservative methods (i.e., child
          fixed-effects and lagged-dependent variables) and robustness checks to assess the internal validity of
          estimates. Across approaches, <mark>spanking predicted reductions in SE skills of .09–.17 SD, even after
            controlling for all time-invariant confounders and baseline levels of SE skills</mark>. These findings

        <p>Objective: This study tested whether the longitudinal effects of mothers' and fathers' corporal punishment
          on children's aggression would vary depending on the context of the parent-child relationship (gender of the
          parent-child dyad, other parenting practices).
          <br>
          <br>
          Method: Participants were 325 children (Mage = 7.44 years, SD = .50) and their parents from Estonia who
          participated in a longitudinal study. Both mothers and fathers filled out measures of parenting practices in
          Grade 1 (corporal punishment, warmth, behavioral and psychological control). Teachers rated children's
          aggressive behavior in Grade 1 and 3.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: We found that the effects of both mothers' and fathers' corporal punishment on changes in
          children's aggressive behavior were conditional. In contexts that were characterized by a lack of parental
          warmth or overuse of behavioral control, <mark>corporal punishment was associated with increases in
            aggression</mark>; in
          parent-child relationships with high levels of parental affection or low levels of behavioral control, it
          was unrelated to, or associated with, decreases in aggression. Some of these conditional effects were
          specific to the gender of the parent and the child.

          <br>
          Conclusions: Our findings suggest that we should try to better understand the complexities of different

        <p>Background: In Finnish society, child maltreatment is a health and social problem with harmful
          consequences. Identifying families at risk may help preventing child maltreatment recurrence.
          <br>
          <br>
          Objective: The aim of this nationwide retrospective cross-sectional study was to describe the child- and
          family-related risk factors associated with physical and psychological abuse experienced by 4-year-old
          children.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: This study analyzed nationwide survey data collected by the Finnish Institute for Health and
          Welfare. Overall, 17,009 parents (46%) visiting at a child health clinic filled out the survey consent form.
          For 8720 children, one or both parents completed the questionnaire (24%). Analyses were carried out using χ2
          tests and binary logistic regression.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: Of the 4-year-olds, 44% had experienced at least one form of psychological abuse and 14% physical
          abuse. These forms of violence co-occurred in 25% of the reported cases (p < 001). Intimate partner violence
            (IPV) and child maltreatment co-occurred in 19.6% of psychological abuse (p < .001) and 22.5% of physical
            abuse cases (p < .001). Parents exposed to IPV was the risk factor most likely to predict an increased risk
            for both psychological abuse (OR 4.01, CI 3.41–4.72; p < .001), and physical abuse (OR 2.19, CI 1.81–2.64; p
            < .001). <mark>Approving of hair-pulling or pinching the child (i.e., using corporal punishment) was most
            likely
            to predict an increased risk of physical abuse (OR 13.70, CI 11.69–16.06; p < .001)</mark>. <br>
              <br>
              Conclusions: The findings emphasize the importance of preventing all forms of child maltreatment by

        <p>Objective: To systematically assess the association between corporal punishment and young children's
          development in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
          <br>
          <br>
          Method: Data for 69 population-based surveys from the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (MICS) were
          combined. The sample included 131,164 children aged 36–59 months living in 49 LMICs. The surveys included
          information about children's developmental status and exposure to corporal punishment in the prior month.
          Logistic models, random-effects meta-analysis, and moderation analysis were used to obtain pooled estimates
          and assess the extent to which the association between corporal punishment and child developmental outcomes
          varied across countries.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: On average, <mark>children exposed to corporal punishment were about 24% (β = 0.76, 95% CI 0.72–0.80)
            less likely to be developmentally on track than children who were not exposed to corporal punishment</mark>.
          Challenges in social-emotional development may drive the association between child development and corporal
          punishment. <mark>Corporal punishment was not associated with any positive developmental outcome in any
            country</mark>.
          There was minor heterogeneity in the estimated associations, which was not explained by the extent to which
          corporal punishment was normative within countries.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusions: All forms of corporal punishment – including spanking – are likely to be harmful to young
          children's development and wellbeing. Public education, legal prohibition of corporal punishment, and other
          efforts are needed to protect children from corporal punishment and promote their wellbeing, health, and
          development.

        <h3>How can I feel safe at home? Adolescents’ experiences of family violence in Ghana.</h3>
        <p class="article-details">Link: <a
            href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.672061">https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.672061</a></p>
        <p>Despite the implementation of various national legal frameworks and global policies such as the UN
          Convention on the Rights of the Child to combat violence against young people, family violence against young
          people is prevalent, especially in WHO African region. Although, research on child maltreatment,
          specifically, for young children has received considerable attention in Ghana recently, there is little
          research on adolescents' experiences of such family violence. In this paper, we report the experiences and
          perceptions of adolescents with respect to family violence they had suffered or witnessed, and analyze the
          socio-ecological factors and power dynamics at home that contribute to such violence. The study employs a
          qualitative approach and the data comprise focus group discussion with 56 adolescents from 14 schools in
          seven districts of Ghana. The findings show that several adolescents in Ghana feel unsafe at home. They
          experience physical, psychological, and sexual violence as well as exposure to intimate partner violence,
          exploitation, and neglect. These violent acts were severe, with dire consequences such as permanent
          impairment and suicide. Perpetrators include all types of carers. The violent acts are often surreptitious
          and poly-victimization is common. The results also reveal that three main socio-ecological factors
          perpetuate and legitimize family violence: patriarchy, <mark>the normalization of corporal punishment as a
            method
            of child discipline</mark>, and superstitious beliefs about health. In general, carers demonstrate their
          superiority and control over the adolescents in an authoritarian manner, thereby, making the adolescents
          powerless. Implications of the study for policy and practice are discussed.</p>

        <h3>Eavesdropping on the family: A pilot investigation of corporal punishment in the home.</h3>

        <p>This study tested the feasibility of using audio recorders to collect novel information about family
          interactions. Research into corporal punishment (CP) has relied, almost exclusively, on self-report data;
          audio recordings have the promise of revealing new insights into the use and immediate consequences of CP.
          So we could hear how parents respond to child conflicts, 33 mothers wore digital audio recorders for up to 6
          evenings. We identified a total of 41 CP incidents, in 15 families and involving 22 parent-child dyads.
          These incidents were evaluated on 6 guidelines culled from the writings of CP advocates. The results
          indicated, contrary to advice, CP was not being used in line with 3 of the 6 recommendations and for 2
          others, the results were equivocal. The last recommendation could not be assessed with audio. Latency
          analyses revealed <mark>children, after being hit, were misbehaving again within 10 minutes after 73% of the
            incidents</mark>. Mothers' self reports about whether they used CP were found to correspond to the audio
          data in
          81% of the cases. Among the mothers who were hitting, <mark>CP occurred at a much higher rate than the
            literature
            indicates</mark>. These results should be viewed as preliminary because of the small sample of families and
          the
          even smaller number of families who used CP. Nevertheless, this pilot study demonstrates that audio
          recording naturally occurring momentary processes in the family is a viable method for collecting new data
          to address important questions about family interactions.</p>

        <h3>Spanking in the home and children’s subsequent aggression toward kindergarten peers.</h3>

            https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954579400006040</a></p>
        <p>Although spanking of children is almost universal in U.S. society, its effects are not well understood. We
          examined the longitudinal relation between parental spanking and other physical punishment of preschool
          children and children's aggressive behavior toward peers later in kindergarten. A total of 273 boys and
          girls from diverse backgrounds served as subjects. The findings were consistent with a socialization model
          in which higher levels of severity in parental punishment practices are associated with higher levels of
          children's subsequent aggression toward peers. Findings indicated that <mark>children who had been spanked
            evidenced levels of aggression that were higher than those who had not been spanked</mark>, and children who
          had
          been the objects of violent discipline became the most aggressive of all groups. Patterns were qualified by
          the sexes of the parent and child and subtypes of child aggression (reactive, bullying, and instrumental).
          The findings suggest that in spite of parents' goals, spanking fails to promote prosocial development and,
          instead, is associated with higher rates of aggression toward peers.</p>

        <h3>Impact of intimate partner violence on parenting and children's externalizing behaviors: Transactional
          processes over time.</h3>

        <p>This study used longitudinal data to examine the transactional associations between mothers' spanking and
          mother-child relationship quality with children's externalizing behaviors in the context of intimate partner
          violence (IPV). Data came from a sample of 1,152 low-income mothers with children age 10-14 years. Results
          showed that past-year IPV triggered transactional associations by increasing children's externalizing
          behaviors which, in turn, <mark>increased spanking and subsequently more externalizing behaviors</mark>.
          Transactional
          associations were also found for relationship quality. All outcomes used were mothers-reported except
          relationship quality. Implications for practice include the importance of the mother-child dyad and their
          reciprocal processes in assessment and treatment.</p>

        <p>Physical punishment is increasingly viewed as a form of violence that harms children. This narrative review
          summarises the findings of 69 prospective longitudinal studies to inform practitioners and policy makers
          about physical punishment's outcomes. Our review identified seven key themes. First, <mark>physical punishment
            consistently predicts increases in child behaviour problems over time</mark>. Second, <mark>physical
            punishment is not
            associated with positive outcomes over time</mark>. Third, <mark>physical punishment increases the risk of
            involvement
            with child protective services</mark>. Fourth, <mark>the only evidence of children eliciting physical
            punishment is for
            externalising behaviour</mark>. Fifth, <mark>physical punishment predicts worsening behaviour over time in
            quasi-experimental studies</mark>. Sixth, <mark>associations between physical punishment and detrimental
            child outcomes
            are robust across child and parent characteristics</mark>. Finally, there is some evidence of a
          dose-response
          relationship. The consistency of these findings indicates that physical punishment is harmful to children
          and that policy remedies are warranted.</p>

        <h3>The role of maternal trauma and discipline types in emotional processing among Syrian refugee children.
        </h3>
        <p class="article-details">Link: <a

        <p>Stressful experiences in armed conflict incur intergenerational effects through parental behaviors with
          their children. A recent study reported that among Syrian refugee families, mothers’ (but not fathers’)
          post-traumatic stress (PTS) impacted children’s emotional processing. In this study, we aim to shed further
          light on this phenomenon by analyzing how the parenting practices in the context of post-traumatic stress
          confers protection or risk for children’s emotional processing. Participants were 6–18-year-old children
          (n = 212) and their mothers (n = 94), who fled from Syria and were residing in Turkish communities. We used
          the computer-based emotional processing task including photos of facial movements typically associated with
          different emotions to measure children’s capacity for emotional processing. Mothers reported their PTS and
          the discipline types they use, as well as the contextual factors related to their refugee background. Linear
          mixed effect models were constructed first, to find out the discipline types that are most strongly
          associated with emotional processing of the child, and second, to examine whether these discipline types
          moderate the effect of maternal PTS on children's emotional processing. Finally, generalized linear models
          were constructed to examine which contextual factors are associated with the use of these discipline types
          by mothers. We found that <mark>spanking as a discipline type was associated with poorer child emotional
            processing</mark>, whereas withholding of media access was associated with better emotional processing.
          Younger and
          less religious mothers were more prone to use spanking. The study underlines the need for parenting programs
          alongside with efforts to address mental health issues among mothers living under armed conflict.</p>

        <p>Most studies and reviews of studies on the developmental consequences of corporal punishment have focused
          on samples from the U.S. and other high-income countries. This study conducted a rapid review of the
          literature on the associations between corporal punishment and children's cognitive and social-emotional
          development in low- and- middle-income countries (LMICs). Information from more than 42 studies of children
          younger than 18 years living in 64 LMICs was reviewed. Overall, the <mark>reviewed studies show associations
            between corporal punishment and negative cognitive and social-emotional outcomes</mark>, and <mark>there is
            no evidence
            that corporal punishment may relate to any positive developmental outcome in LMICs</mark>. Yet, issues of
          internal
          and external validity are common in the literature. The <mark>current evidence indicates that corporal
            punishment
            might increase the risk of detrimental child outcomes in LMICs</mark>, but further research with stronger

        <h3>The association between spanking and physical abuse of young children in 56 low- and middle-income
          countries.</h3>

        <p>Background: Nearly one third of children under five in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) experience
          spanking. Studies from North America suggest that spanking is associated with heightened risk of physical
          abuse. However, the link between spanking and physical abuse in the international context remains
          understudied.
          <br>
          <br>
          Objective: To examine the association between caregivers' spanking and physical abuse of young children in
          LMICs, and to estimate the extent to which physical abuse might be reduced if spanking were eliminated.
          <br>
          <br>
          Participants: We used nationally representative data from 156,166 1- to 4-year-old children in 56 LMICs from
          the fourth and fifth rounds of UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: A nationally weighted multilevel logistic regression model examined the association between
          spanking and physical abuse. We calculated predicted probabilities of physical abuse, which we present using
          natural frequencies.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: <mark>Spanking was associated with higher odds of physical abuse (OR = 5.74, p < .001)</mark>. The
              predicted
              probability of physical abuse decreased by 14% comparing children who were spanked (22%) and who were not
              spanked (8%). When our estimates were translated to a hypothetical sample of 100 children using a natural
              frequency approach, 32 children were spanked; of those, seven experienced physical abuse. The elimination
              of
              spanking would result in four fewer children who were exposed to physical abuse. In relation to the
              population of abused children, <mark>estimates suggest that physical abuse could reduce by up to 33% if
                spanking
                were eliminated</mark>. <br>
              <br>
              Conclusions: Results support the UN Sustainable Development Goals Target 16.2 that calls for eliminating
              all forms of violence against children. Child welfare advocates should discourage caregivers from using
              spanking, in order to prevent physical abuse.

        <p>Background: Previous research demonstrates that there are environmental and genetic factors associated with
          the use of corporal punishment (CP) and children's behavior problems. Thus, it is difficult to disentangle
          whether CP has a causal effect on children's developmental outcomes.
          <br>
          <br>
          Objective: This study explored the relationship between maternal use of CP at ages 3-4 years and symptoms of
          internalizing and externalizing behavior problems between the ages of 6 and 9 years using a sibling
          comparison design. In doing so, we were able to control for shared environmental factors and partially
          control for genetic factors that could explain the relationship between CP and behavior problems.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: This study analyzed data from 11,506 children from the United States. We used generalized linear
          models to assess the relationship between the use of CP and behavior problems among biological siblings
          raised in the same home.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: At the population level, <mark>CP was significantly associated with the development of internalizing
            behavior problems</mark> (β = 0.134, SE = 0.03, p < .001). When comparing siblings, this relationship was no
            longer significant. In contrast, <mark>CP was significantly associated with externalizing behavior problems
            at both the
            population (β=0.233, SE=0.02, p < .001) and sibling comparison level (β=0.107, SE=0.03, p < .001)</mark>.
              <br>
              <br>
              Conclusion: We did not find evidence to suggest that the association between CP and externalizing behavior
              problems is due to environmental and genetic factors exclusively. Corroborating previous research, these
              results suggest that CP may increase the likelihood of externalizing behavior problems.

        <p>Background: Prior literature has demonstrated the associations of parental physical punishment with child
          behavior problems and increased risk of physical abuse. In South Korea, physical punishment is a common
          parenting practice. In 2021, legislative reforms eliminated legal grounds for parental physical punishment
          in South Korea. However, research on physical punishment, physical abuse, and child behavior problems in the
          Korean context is scarce.
          <br>
          <br>
          Objective: This study examined whether physical punishment and physical abuse have unique associations with
          child behavior problems and whether physical punishment is associated with increased exposure to physical
          abuse.
          <br>
          <br>
          Participants and setting: Data came from the 2010 Korean Child and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS), a nationally
          representative sample of South Korean children who attended 1st grade in 2010. Our analyses were based on
          three waves of the KCYPS (N = 2,180).
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: We employed fixed-effects regression to examine the associations of physical punishment and
          physical abuse with child behavior problems and the association of physical punishment with physical abuse
          after controlling for time-invariant characteristics.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: <mark>Exposure to physical punishment and physical abuse was associated with higher levels of
            aggression,
            depression, and lower levels of academic behavior regulation. Physical punishment was associated with
            increased risk of physical abuse</mark>.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusions: Our findings suggest that physical punishment is a risk for child behavior problems and
          physical abuse in South Korea. Child maltreatment prevention efforts should focus on shifting favorable
          social norms around physical punishment and promoting non-physical disciplinary practices.

        <p>Background: Spanking is a risk factor for children's social competency. However, establishing causality is
          a challenge, given selection bias in samples and the possibility of confounding the harms of excessive
          spanking with the effects of infrequent spanking.
          <br>
          <br>
          Objective: This study addressed these causality issues to strengthen the causal estimates of the links
          between spanking and children's social competency.
          <br>
          <br>
          Participants and setting: The study used longitudinal US kindergarten cohort data from children aged 5 to 7.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: The study used matching and lagged dependent variables to mitigate selection bias associated with
          lifetime (Ns = 17,171-17,537) and recent (Ns = 10,393-10,724) incidence of spanking. Cases in which spanking
          frequency exceeded two times a week were excluded. Sample sizes are provided in ranges due to the variations
          across multiple imputed samples.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: <mark>Lifetime experience of spanking by age 5 was associated with higher externalizing behaviors at
            ages
            6 and 7, and with lower self-control and interpersonal skills at age 6</mark>. A <mark>recent incidence of
            spanking at
            age 5 was associated with higher externalizing behaviors, lower self-control, and lower interpersonal skills
            at ages 6 and 7</mark>. These results remain significant after cases of frequent spanking were excluded.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusion: The results support the argument that spanking harms children's social development.

        <h3>An examination of parents' adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) history and reported spanking of their

        <p>The current evidence indicates that spanking is harmful to children's health and development and should
          never be used by parents or other caregivers. However, the critical factors that inform effective spanking
          prevention strategies are still not well understood. The objective of the current study was to determine if
          a parent's own adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) history was associated with increased likelihood of
          reporting their child being spanked at age 10 or younger. Data were drawn from the Well-Being and
          Experiences Study (the WE Study), a community survey of parents and adolescents from 2017-2018 (N = 1000)
          from Canada. <mark>The results indicated that a parent's own history of physical abuse, emotional abuse,
            spanking,
            and household mental illness in childhood were associated with an increased likelihood that their child
            would have been spanked</mark>. These findings indicate that a parent's ACEs history may be related to how
          their
          own child is parented and identify families who may be more likely to rely on spanking. Preventing physical
          punishment is necessary for healthy child development, reducing the risk of further violence, and upholding
          children's rights to protection. Parent's ACEs history may be an important factor to consider when
          developing and implementing child maltreatment prevention efforts.</p>

        <p>Violence against children is a significant problem, particularly during early childhood development.
          Spanking and other forms of corporal punishment in child-rearing have been used by families worldwide to
          correct children's unwanted behaviors. Despite previous studies focusing on the negative consequences of
          these parental practices, open questions remain. The present study aimed to systematically review the
          empirical studies published in scientific literature that examined the associations between parenting
          practices of spanking and corporal punishment of mothers and their children's behaviors and development in
          early childhood. Search was performed in PubMed, APA PsycNet, Web of Science, SciELO, and LILACS databases
          using the combination of the following keywords: ((spank OR physical punishment OR physical abuse OR
          physical maltreatment OR corporal punishment) AND (parenting)) AND (child* development OR child* behavior).
          The inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and 34 articles were selected for review. The inclusion
          criteria were the following: studies that evaluated associations between maternal spanking or corporal
          punishment practices and behaviors or development of 0-to-6-year-old children; quantitative studies; studies
          published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese language. <mark>The results showed that in 94% of the studies,
            there
            were significant associations between maternal spanking and corporal punishment with deteriorated child
            behavior and development, concurrently or later</mark>. In addition, maternal physical practices also acted
          as
          mediators or moderator variables in models that explained behavioral and developmental problems in early
          childhood.</p>

        <h3>Associations between lifetime spanking/slapping and adolescent physical and mental health and behavioral
          outcomes.</h3>
        <p class="article-details">Link: <a

        <p>Background: Many parents use physical forms of punishment, including spanking to correct perceived
          misbehavior. While some authors suggest spanking/slapping is a distinct and “milder” form of physical
          punishment, parents’ use of spanking is consistently associated with poor outcomes for their children.
          However, less is known about the relationship between spanking/slapping and health and behavioral outcomes
          in adolescence independent of other childhood adversities.
          <br>
          <br>
          Objective: The objectives of this study were to examine the associations between lifetime experiences of
          spanking on the bottom and/or slapping on the hand and 3 adolescent outcomes: (a) mental health disorders,
          (b) physical health conditions, and (c) defiant behaviors, after adjusting for other types of childhood
          adversities and child maltreatment.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: Cross-sectional data from the provincially representative 2014 Ontario Child Health Study (N =
          6,537 dwellings, response rate = 50.8%) were used. The current study focused on one selected child aged 14
          to 17 years within a household (n = 1,883) with data collected from the adolescent and the parent/caregiver.
          Logistic regression models were used to identify associations with lifetime experiences of spanking/slapping
          3 or more times (vs. 0 to 2 times).
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: <mark>Lifetime spanking/slapping was independently associated with increased odds of mental health
            disorders, physical health conditions, and defiant behaviors in adolescence after adjusting for childhood
            adversities and child maltreatment (unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.29 to 2.19)</mark>.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusion: These findings suggest that lifetime spanking/slapping is uniquely associated with harmful
          mental, physical, and behavioral outcomes in adolescence, and efforts should focus on its prevention.

        <h3>Harsh physical discipline and externalizing behaviors in children: A systematic review.</h3>

        <p>There is growing debate in the parenting literature as to whether using physical punishment to discipline
          children is an effective strategy or leads to the development of aggressive behaviors and other antisocial
          attributes. The aim of the current literature review is to examine the association between harsh physical
          discipline and the development of externalizing behaviors in children, as well as the suggested moderators
          of this relationship. Secondly, the findings regarding the effects of harsh physical discipline on
          children's educational outcomes are reviewed. Articles were selected from relevant databases while
          maintaining an inclusion and exclusion criteria, with a total of 22 articles included in this review. Strong
          associations between parental corporal punishment and a range of child behaviors were indicated by the
          literature, and cultural normativeness was implicated as a moderator of these effects. Results regarding the
          role of parental warmth as a moderator did not provide a firm conclusion. Finally, the findings suggest that
          <mark>when a child is subjected to physical discipline in the home, their life at school may be adversely
            affected
            by impaired cognitive performance, peer isolation, and behavioral problems</mark>. The primary limitation of
          the
          studies reviewed is the use of self-report data and correlational analyses, ruling out the possibility of
          inferring causal relations. Nonetheless, the results indicate the necessity of encouraging parents and
          caregivers to avoid physical punishment as a disciplinary tactic while providing them with the tools to
          explore alternative practices.

        <h3>Corporal punishment bans and adolescent suicide rates: An international ecological study.</h3>

        <p>Background: Exposure to corporal punishment during childhood is associated with suicidal behaviors during
          adolescence. To date, the protective effects of national policies governing the use of corporal punishment
          have rarely been studied for adolescent suicide outcomes.
          <br>
          <br>
          Objective: To investigate contemporaneous and lagged associations between national legislation banning
          corporal punishment and adolescent suicide rates.
          <br>
          <br>
          Participants and setting: We used population-level administrative and mortality data from 97 countries
          spanning the years 1950 to 2017.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: Negative binomial models were used to investigate the relationship between the existence of
          official corporal punishment bans in countries and national adolescent suicide mortality rates and the
          potential time lag between the enactment of such bans and reductions in adolescent suicide rates.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: <mark>National policies that permitted corporal punishment in all settings (homes, schools, daycares,
            and
            alternative care) were associated with a higher relative risk (RR) for suicide in females aged 15-19 (RR =
            2.07, p = .03), as were policies allowing corporal punishment in schools specifically (RR = 2.01, p =
            .02)</mark>.
          Partial bans of corporal punishment and bans of school corporal punishment showed lagged effects on suicide
          rates which peaked after 12 years for females aged 15-19 and after 13 years for males aged 15-19.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusion: Study findings add to a body of evidence that suggests that official policies banning corporal
          punishment may promote adolescent health and well-being. The benefits of such policies in terms of reduced
          risk for adolescent suicide appear to peak approximately 12 to 13 years after enactment of the legislation.

        </p>
        <p>Background: Extant literature has primarily employed linear models to estimate the average effect of
          spanking on children. Less is known about child and parent characteristics that may predict differential
          risks of children’s exposure to spanking (i.e., pre-treatment heterogeneity) and the effect of spanking on
          child outcomes that may differ by the propensity for spanking (i.e., post-treatment heterogeneity).
          <br>
          <br>
          Objective: The present study examines pre- and post-treatment heterogeneity in the association between
          maternal spanking at child age 3 and subsequent household Child Protective Services (CPS) involvement that
          were reported by mothers between child ages 3 to 5.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: The sample consisted of 2,422 families from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a birth
          cohort study that oversampled children born to unmarried families. A propensity score stratification
          analysis procedure examined pre- and post-treatment heterogeneity in the association between spanking and
          subsequent household CPS involvement. Children were stratified into three strata depending on their
          propensity for experiencing spanking. Subsequently, the association between spanking and household CPS
          involvement was examined for each stratum.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: <mark>Disadvantaged socio-economic characteristics, negative psychosocial conditions of the mother,
            and
            dysregulated temperament of the child were associated with elevated risk of spanking</mark>. The odds of
          subsequent
          household CPS involvement increased by 2.4 times (β = 0.869, p <.01) for children in the stratum with the
            lowest propensity for experiencing spanking. <br>
            <br>
            Conclusion: Results emphasize the importance of promoting alternative disciplinary strategies to families
            who would be considered low-risk before they may come into contact with the child welfare system.

        <p>Background: Spanking has been linked to multiple maladaptive child outcomes. However, previous research
          linking spanking with children's executive function skills (EFs; inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility,
          and working memory) is limited by research designs that do not adequately address selection bias concerns,
          wherein the participant characteristics potentially differ between those who are spanked versus not spanked.
          <br>
          <br>
          Objective: Using a representative sample of US children aged 5 to 6, this study strengthened the evidence
          for causal estimates on the link between spanking and subsequent EFs with a matched-group design.
          Low-frequency spanking and potential moderators (child gender, parent race/ethnicity, parental warmth) were
          tested to determine if they moderated the link between spanking and EFs.
          <br>
          <br>
          Participants: Data were drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11 (Ns
          = 12,750-12,830). To mitigate selection bias, entropy-balanced matching was utilized to match spanked versus
          not-spanked groups, and lagged dependent variable regression analyses were conducted on the matched sample
          to predict EFs by spanking group status.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: After matching, <mark>spanking at age 5 was associated with lower inhibitory control and lower
            cognitive
            flexibility at age 6</mark>, but was not significantly predictive of later working memory. The association
          with
          inhibitory control was observed even for low frequency spanking. However, no evidence of moderation by child
          gender, parent race/ethnicity, and parental warmth was identified.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusion: This study provides evidence that spanking is associated with lower executive functioning in
          children, although the associations varied by different EF domains.

        <p>Spanking remains common around the world, despite evidence linking corporal punishment to detrimental child
          outcomes. This study tested whether children (Mage = 11.60) who were spanked (N = 40) exhibited altered
          neural function in response to stimuli that suggest the presence of an environmental threat compared to
          children who were not spanked (N = 107). <mark>Children who were spanked exhibited greater activation in
            multiple

            neutral faces compared to children who were not spanked</mark>. These findings suggest that spanking may

        <p>The current study longitudinally examined bidirectional associations between callous-unemotional (CU)
          traits and parenting dimensions. This study extended the literature by examining whether parental depression
          moderated these relations in a pre-adolescent sample. Proposed relations were examined using a longitudinal
          sample of 120 aggressive children (59.6 % male) who were in the 4th grade (M = 10.56 years, SD = 0.56) at
          baseline and were followed annually over 4 years. A series of generalized estimating equation (GEE) models
          were used to examine proposed relations. At the first order level, corporal punishment (p < . 001) and poor
            supervision/monitoring predicted increases in CU traits (p=0.03) however, the inverse relations were not
            found. Importantly, parental depression moderated the link between corporal punishment and CU traits.
            Specifically, <mark>at high levels of depression, corporal punishment was predictive of increases in CU
            traits</mark>,
            but was unrelated to CU traits at low levels of depression. These findings aid in our understanding of the
            link between corporal punishment and CU traits by highlighting conditions under which certain parenting
            behaviors have an impact on CU traits, which in turn, may have important intervention implications. Further
            clinical implications, limitations and future directions are discussed.</p>

        <p>Harsh or frequent spanking in early childhood is an established risk factor for later childhood behavioral
          problems as well as mental disorder in adulthood in Western societies. However, few studies have been
          conducted in Asian populations, where corporal punishment is relatively accepted. Moreover, the impacts of
          occasional spanking on subsequent behavioral problems remain uncertain. This study sought to investigate
          prospectively the association between the frequency of spanking of toddlers and later behavioral problems in
          Japanese children using national birth cohort data. We used data from the Longitudinal Survey of Newborns in
          the 21st Century, a population-based birth cohort data set collected by the Japanese Ministry of Health,
          Labour, and Welfare (N=29,182). Frequency of spanking ("never", "sometimes" and "always") and child
          behavioral problems were assessed via a caregiver questionnaire when the child was 3.5 years old and again
          at 5.5 years. Propensity score matching was used to examine the association between frequency of spanking
          and child behavioral problems, adjusting for parental socioeconomic status, child temperament and parenting

        <p>Although all professionals oppose abusive physical punishment, nonabusive physical punishment is still
          controversial. The aim of the present study was (i) to determine parents' behavior regarding the discipline
          of their children using corporal punishment or other alternative disciplinary methods, (ii) to identify the
          different associated factors for corporal punishment, and (iii) to determine the association between
          exposure of the child to corporal punishment and his or her psychosocial well-being. A representative sample
          of 400 fifth-grade primary school children and their mothers were subjected to a cross-sectional survey.
          Mothers were subjected to a questionnaire to assess their behavior on corporal punishment and other
          disciplinary methods. The children were subjected to Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory to assess their
          self-esteem, and a questionnaire to assess their relationship with others. About three-quarter of children
          (76.3%) were corporally punished, and about half of them (46.2%) were punished on sites other than the
          extremities or buttocks. In 59.3% of them the frequency of the punishment ranged from once or twice/week to
          more than once/day, and it left marks in about 20%. Other disciplinary methods used by mothers were
          yelling/insulting (43.5%), taking away a toy or privilege (39.3%), discussing/explaining (9.5%), and time
          out (2.8%). The significant predictors of mothers' use of corporal punishment were male gender of the child
          (p < 0.01), rural origin of the father (p=0.02), the mother's bad history of rearing experience (p < 0.01),
            and poor interparental relationship (p=0.02). The relation between corporal punishment of children and their
            self-esteem was not statistically significant; however, <mark>corporally punished children scored lower on
            their
            relationship with others than noncorporally punished ones </mark> (Z=2.60, p < 0.05). Corporal punishment is
              a widespread disciplinary method in Alexandria. The use of corporal punishment could have adverse effects
              on the child especially on his or her relationship with others. Planning an awareness-raising educational
              program for current and expectant parents is recommended, to promote positive nonviolent methods of child
              rearing, via the media and campaigns, and encouragement of political, community, and religious leaders;
              medical personnel; journalists; and sports and entertainment figures to share in these campaigns.</p>

        <h3>Household economic hardship as a moderator of the associations between maternal spanking and child
          externalizing behavior problems.</h3>
        <p class="article-details">Link: <a
            href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104573">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104573</a></p>
        <p>Background: Spanking is associated with detrimental outcomes for young children. Research shows that
          spanking is more commonly used in low-income households.
          <br>
          <br>
          Objective: To examine whether economic hardship, measured by household income-to-poverty ratio at the time
          of the child's birth, moderated the longitudinal associations between maternal spanking and child
          externalizing behavior problems during the first nine years of childhood.
          <br>
          <br>
          Participants and setting: Mother-child pairs (N = 4,149) from a cohort study of urban families in 20 US
          cities.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: Cross-lagged path models examined associations between maternal spanking and externalizing behavior
          when children were between the ages of 1 and 9. Multigroup analyses examined whether income-to-poverty ratio
          moderated these associations.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: Bivariate analyses showed that income-to-poverty ratio was associated with child externalizing
          behavior problems at each time point; income-to-poverty ratio was associated with maternal spanking at age 3
          only. Longitudinal path model results indicated that, for low- and middle-income groups, maternal
          <mark>spanking
            at each age had significant associations with child externalizing behavior at each subsequent age</mark>.
          For the
          high-income group, maternal <mark>spanking at age 1 and age 3 had significant associations with child
            externalizing behavior at each subsequent age</mark>; however, spanking at age 5 was not associated with
          child
          externalizing behavior at age 9.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusion: Spanking is disadvantageous for children at all income levels, with more persistent effects in
          low- and middle-income families. For higher-income families, the associations of maternal spanking with
          child externalizing behavior problems may be attenuated as child age increases. Regardless of income level,
          parents should be advised against spanking.

        <p>Background and objective: Previous cross-sectional research suggested a link between parental corporal
          punishment, school violence, and cyberbullying among adolescents. However, their temporal relationships
          remain unclear. This study used longitudinal panel data to examine the temporal relationships between
          parental corporal punishment, adolescent school violence against peers and teachers, and cyberbullying
          perpetration.
          <br>
          <br>
          Participants and setting: Seven hundred and two junior high school students from Taiwan participated.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: A probability sample and two waves of longitudinal panel data collected a nine-month apart were
          analyzed. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect students' self-reported information about
          their experiences of parental corporal punishment, perpetration of school violence against peers and
          teachers, and cyberbullying.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: <mark>Parental corporal punishment at Time 1 predicted violence against school peers, violence
            against
            teachers, and cyberbullying perpetration at Time 2</mark>; however, these three behaviors at Time 1 did not
          predict
          parental corporal punishment at Time 2. These findings applied to both sex groups, although the effects of
          parental corporal punishment on violence against teachers were slightly stronger for boys than girls.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusion: Parental corporal punishment is a predictor rather than an outcome of adolescent school violence
          against peers and teachers and cyberbullying. Policies and interventions need to target parental corporal
          punishment to prevent adolescents from engaging in violence against peers and teachers and cyberbullying.

        <h3>Corporal punishment is uniquely associated with a greater neural response to errors and blunted neural
          response to rewards in adolescence.</h3>

        <p>Background: Although corporal punishment is a common form of punishment with known negative impacts on
          health and behavior, how such punishment affects neurocognitive systems is relatively unknown.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: To address this issue, we examined how corporal punishment affected neural measures of error and
          reward processing in 149 adolescent boys and girls of ages 11 to 14 years (mean age [SD] = 11.02 [1.16]).
          Corporal punishment experienced over the lifetime was assessed using the Stress and Adversity Inventory. In
          addition, participants completed a flankers task and a reward task to measure the error-related negativity
          and reward positivity, respectively, as well as measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: As hypothesized, <mark>participants who experienced lifetime corporal punishment reported more
            anxiety
            and depressive symptoms</mark>. Experiencing <mark>corporal punishment was also related to a larger
            error-related
            negativity and blunted reward positivity</mark>. Importantly, corporal punishment was independently related
          to a
          larger error-related negativity and a more blunted reward positivity beyond the impact of harsh parenting
          and lifetime stressors.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusion: Corporal punishment appears to potentiate neural response to errors and decrease neural response
          to rewards, which could increase risk for anxiety and depressive symptoms.

        <p>Studies have linked the use of corporal punishment of children to the development of mental health

          influence of laws banning corporal punishment. Using data from the School Children Mental Health Europe
          survey, the objective of this cross-sectional study was to examine the prevalence and legal status of
          corporal punishment across six European countries and to evaluate the association between parental use of
          corporal punishment and children's mental health. The study found that odds of having parents who reported
          using occasional to frequent corporal punishment were 1.7 times higher in countries where its use is legal,
          controlling for socio-demographic factors. <mark>Children with parents who reported using corporal punishment

        <p>Background: Previous research has established links between corporal punishment and children's
          developmental problems, but few studies have investigated the moderating effect of positive parenting
          between corporal punishment and children's developmental difficulties in detail. This study investigated the

          evaluates children's developmental problems.
          <br>

          Results: <mark>Corporal punishment was associated with worse emotional and behavioral problems in

          children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in low-income urban African American and
          Hispanic (N = 592) families drawn from the Three City Study. Children in sample families were followed from
          early childhood through middle childhood with 3 sets of interviews and assessments at ages 3, 4, and 9
          years. Cross-lagged path analyses tested longitudinal bidirectional associations between parental
          endorsement of spanking and children's internalizing and externalizing problems, with multigroup comparisons
          employed to test group differences between race/ethnic groups. African American and Hispanic mothers showed
          similar endorsements of spanking. Results suggest that associations between spanking endorsement and child

        <p>Despite a growing literature associating physical discipline with later child aggression, spanking remains
          a typical experience for American children. The directionality of the associations between aggression and
          spanking and their continuity over time has received less attention. This study examined the transactional
          associations between spanking and externalizing behavior across the first decade of life, examining not only
          how spanking relates to externalizing behavior leading up to the important transition to adolescence, but
          whether higher levels of externalizing lead to more spanking over time as well. We use data from the Fragile
          families and child well-being (FFCW) study to examine maternal spanking and children's behavior at ages 1,
          3, 5, and 9 (N = 1,874; 48% girls). The FFCW is a longitudinal birth cohort study of children born between
          1998 and 2000 in 20 medium to large US cities. A little over a quarter of this sample was spanked at age 1,
          and about half at age 3, 5, and 9. Estimates from a cross-lagged path model provided evidence of
          developmental continuity in both spanking and externalizing behavior, but results also highlighted important
          reciprocal processes taking hold early, with <mark>spanking influencing later externalizing behavior, which,
            in
            turn, predicted subsequent spanking</mark>. These bidirectional effects held across race/ethnicity and
          child's
          gender. The findings highlight the lasting effects of early spanking, both in influencing early child's
          behavior, and in affecting subsequent child's externalizing and parental spanking in a reciprocal manner.
          These amplifying transactional processes underscore the importance of early intervention before patterns may
          cascade across domains in the transition to adolescence.</p>

        <p>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that societal rates of corporal punishment of children predict societal
          levels of violence, using "culture" as the unit of analysis.
          <br>
          <br>
        <p>DESIGN: Data were retrieved from the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample of anthropological records, which
          includes 186 cultural groups, to represent the world's 200 provinces based on diversity of language,
          economy, political organization, descent, and historical time. Independent coders rated the frequency and
          harshness of corporal punishment of children, inculcation of aggression in children, warfare, interpersonal
          violence among adults, and demographic, socioeconomic, and parenting covariates.
          <br>
          <br>
          RESULTS: <mark>More frequent use of corporal punishment was related to higher rates of inculcation of
            aggression
            in children, warfare, and interpersonal violence</mark>. These relations held for inculcation of aggression
          in
          children and warfare after controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and parenting confounds.
          <br>
          <br>
          CONCLUSION: More frequent use of corporal punishment is related to higher prevalence of violence and
          endorsement of violence at a societal level. The findings are consistent with theories that adult violence
          becomes more prevalent in contexts in which corporal punishment is frequent, that the use of corporal
          punishment increases the probability that children will engage in violent behaviors during adulthood, and
          that violence in one social domain tends to influence behavior in other domains. If corporal punishment
          leads to higher levels of societal violence, then reducing parents' use of corporal punishment should lead
          to reductions in societal violence manifested in other ways.

          each year from about age five, this study of a large national sample of U.S. adults found that almost half

          investigate the possibility that corporal punishment puts adolescents at increased risk of developing mental
          health and social relationship problems later in life. The analysis, which controlled for a number of
          possible confounding risk factors such as low socioeconomic status, found that <mark>children who experienced
            corporal punishment in adolescence had an increased risk later in life of depressive symptoms, suicidal

          adolescents are victims of corporal punishment by their parents, indicates a need to replicate the study
          using longitudinal data. If the findings are confirmed, it suggests that a major step in primary prevention
          of violence and mental health problems can be achieved by a national effort to reduce or eliminate all use
          of corporal punishment.</p>

        <p>This study examined the prevalence and determinants of spanking of children at 3 years-of-age, and the
          associations between spanking and externalizing behavior and receptive verbal ability at age 5. Overall, we
          find maternal spanking rates of 55.2% and paternal rates of 43.2% at age 3. Mothers facing greater stress
          and those who spanked earlier are more likely to spank at age 3, whereas those who report a supportive
          partner during pregnancy and those who were not U.S. born were less likely to spank. Mothers and fathers in
          communities where spanking was more normative were more likely to spank. Fathers were less likely to spank
          daughters at age 3. Frequent maternal <mark>spanking at age 3 was associated with externalizing behavior and
            receptive vocabulary at age 5, controlling for an array of ecological risks, earlier behavior, and verbal
            capacity</mark>. Taking advantage of the large and diverse sample we explored potential interactions and
          found no
          evidence that race, parental warmth, normativeness, or child gender moderated the association between
          spanking and externalizing or receptive vocabulary. These findings add to the literature on negative
          consequences associated with a widely endorsed parenting practice, and highlight the need for research that
          explores alternative effective discipline practices and addresses parent questions of what else they could,
          or even should, be doing.</p>

        <p>Exposure to violence is a serious mental and public health issue. In particular, children exposed to
          violence are at risk for poor developmental outcomes and physical and mental health problems. One area that
          has been shown to increase the risk for poor outcomes is the use of corporal punishment as a discipline
          method. While researchers are starting to ask children directly about their experiences of violence, there
          is limited research with children about their perspectives on physical punishment, particularly in low-and
          middle-income countries (LMIC). This paper begins to address this gap by reporting on the spontaneous data
          that emerged during 24 qualitative interviews that were conducted with children, aged 8-12 in South Africa.
          <mark>The themes that emerged indicated that corporal punishment is an everyday experience, that it has
            negative
            emotional and behavioral consequences, and that it plays a role in how children resolve interpersonal
            conflicts</mark>. The study highlights the challenges for violence prevention interventions in

        <p>A robust research literature links parental spanking with negative behavioral outcomes for children,
          however, it remains unclear whether conditions in the community may moderate the associations between
          spanking and behavior problems in early childhood. In the current study, we examined whether community
          violence exposure moderated the associations of maternal spanking with externalizing and internalizing
          behavior problems of young children. The sample used in this study was urban families and their children
          ages 3-5 (n = 2,472). We used fixed effects regression models, which yield stronger statistical control for
          baseline behavior problems, selection bias, and omitted variables bias. Mother's <mark>spanking was associated
            with elevated levels of both externalizing (β = .037, p < .001) and internalizing (β=.016, p < .001)
              behavior problems</mark>. Community violence exposure also predicted higher levels of externalizing
              (β=.071, p < .01) and internalizing (β=.043, p < .05) behavior problems. Community violence exposure did
                not moderate the associations between maternal spanking and behavior problems. Professionals working
                with families should promote the use of nonphysical disciplinary practices, regardless of the level of
                violence and crime in the community in which the family resides.</p>

        <h3>Early risk pathways to physical versus relational peer aggression: The interplay of externalizing behavior
          and corporal punishment varies by child sex.</h3>

        </p>
        <p>Children who aggress against their peers may use physical or relational forms, yet little research has
          looked at early childhood risk factors and characteristics that uniquely predict high levels of relational
          versus physical aggression in preadolescence. Accordingly, the main aim of our study was to link early
          corporal punishment and externalizing behavior to children's physical and relational peer aggression during
          preadolescence and to examine how these pathways differed by sex. Participants were 193, 3-year-old boys
          (39%) and girls who were reassessed following the transition to kindergarten (5.5 years) and preadolescence
          (10.5 years). A series of autoregressive, cross-lagged path analyses were conducted to examine the
          relationships between child externalizing problems and corporal punishment at ages 3 and 5.5 years, and
          their association with physical and relational aggression at age 10.5. Multiple group analysis was used to
          determine whether pathways differed by sex. Three developmental pathways were identified: (i) direct
          associations between stable childhood externalizing problems and later physical aggression; (ii) <mark>a
            direct
            pathway from early corporal punishment to preadolescent relational and physical peer aggression</mark>; and
          (iii)
          <mark>an indirect pathway from early corporal punishment to later physical aggression via continuing
            externalizing
            problems in middle childhood</mark>. Child sex moderated the nature of these pathways, as well as the
          direction of
          association between risk and outcome variables. These data advance our understanding of the etiology of
          distinct forms of peer aggression and highlight the potential for more efficacious prevention and
          intervention efforts in the early childhood years.

        <p>Neighborhood and parenting influences on early behavioral outcomes are strongly dependent upon a child's
          stage of development. However, little research has jointly considered the longitudinal associations of
          neighborhood and parenting processes with behavior problems in early childhood. To address this limitation,
          this study explores the associations of neighborhood collective efficacy and maternal corporal punishment
          with the longitudinal patterns of early externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. The study sample
          consisted of 3,705 families from a nationally representative cohort study of urban families. Longitudinal
          multilevel models examined the associations of collective efficacy and corporal punishment with behavior
          problems at age 3, as well as with patterns of behavior problems between the ages 3 to 5. Interactions
          between the main predictors and child age tested whether neighborhood and parent relationships with child
          behavior varied over time. Mediation analysis examined whether neighborhood influences on child behavior
          were mediated by parenting. The models controlled for a comprehensive set of possible confounders at the
          child, parent, and neighborhood levels. Results indicate that both maternal <mark>corporal punishment and low
            neighborhood collective efficacy were significantly associated with increased behavior problems</mark>. The
          significant interaction between collective efficacy and child age with internalizing problems suggests that
          neighborhood influences on internalizing behavior were stronger for younger children. The indirect effect of
          low collective efficacy on behavior problems through corporal punishment was not significant. These findings
          highlight the importance of multilevel interventions that promote both neighborhood collective efficacy and
          nonphysical discipline in early childhood.</p>

        <p>The cultural normativeness perspective argues that parenting practices such as spanking are more beneficial
          for children when they occur in cultural groups within which they are normative. Research on this issue in

          and Black (n = 3,065) American children (5 to 14 years of age). Mean weighted effect sizes for both groups

        </h3>

        <p>Background: According to the World Health Organization, >200 million children in low- and middle-income
          countries experience developmental delays. However, household structure and parenting practices have been
          minimally explored as potential correlates of developmental delay in low- and middle-income countries,
          despite potential as areas for intervention.
          <br>
          <br>
          Objective: The objective of the study was to examine associations of developmental delays with use of World
          Health Organization-recommended parenting practices among a clinic-based cohort of children aged 6-60 months
          attending in La Romana, Dominican Republic.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: This study was conducted among 74 caregiver-child pairs attending the growth-monitoring clinic at
          Hospital Francisco Gonzalvo in June 2015. The Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool was adapted and performed
          on each child to assess socioadaptive, fine motor, gross motor, and language development. The IMCI Household
          Level Survey Questionnaire was used to assess parenting practices. Fisher's exact test was used to determine
          associations significant at P < .05. Significant variables were then entered into a multivariable logistic
            regression. <br>
            <br>
            Findings: Almost two-thirds of children had a delay in at least 1 developmental domain. Most caregivers
            used scolding (43.2%) or spanking (44%) for child discipline. <mark>Children who were disciplined by
              spanking
              and scolding were more likely to have language delay (P = .007) and socioadaptive delay (P = .077),
              respectively</mark>. On regression analysis, children with younger primary caregivers had 7 times higher
            odds of
            language delay (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 7.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.52-35.61) and 4 times
            greater odds of any delay (AOR: 4.72, 95% CI: 1.01-22.22). In addition, <mark>children punished by spanking
              had
              5 times higher odds of having language delay</mark> (AOR: 5.04, 95% CI: 1.13-22.39).
            <br>
            <br>
            Conclusion: Parenting practices such as harsh punishment and lack of positive parental reinforcement were
            found to have strong associations with language and socioadaptive delays. Likewise, delays were also more
            common among children with younger caregivers.

          <mark>corporal
            punishment predicted subsequent children's externalizing behavior</mark> (parent-driven effects), whereas
          children's externalizing behavior predicted subsequent maternal and paternal psychological aggression
          (child-driven effects). The parent-driven effects became stronger, whereas the child-driven effects were
          equally strong across time. Furthermore, the parent-driven effects for corporal punishment were found for
          both boys and girls, whereas the child-driven effects for psychological aggression were found only for boys.

        <p>Purpose: This preliminary study was designed to assess the feasibility of examining early childhood
          parenting factors and their relationship with adult past month drug use among low-income African American
          women.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 156 low-income African American women was conducted. Measures included
          the childhood parental bonding scale, frequency of exposure to corporal punishment (CP) in childhood, The
          Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST) and The Differentiation of Self Scale. Structural equation modeling (SEM)
          was used to assess the relationship between the primary predictors, latent parental bonding and corporal
          punishment exposure, with past month drug use. The intermediary construct, emotional reactivity, was also
          included in the SEM model to test mechanisms of mediation.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: There was a significant main effect for maternal care on lower emotional reactivity patterns in
          adulthood. There was also <mark>a significant main effect for frequent CP on higher emotional reactivity
            patterns
            in adulthood</mark>. The relationship between both parenting measures and drug use were mediated by
          emotional
          reactivity.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusion: Childhood maternal factors are a strong predictor of adult past month drug use, and this may be
          accounted for, in part, by the influence that parenting patterns in childhood have on adult emotional
          reactivity patterns. These observations should be examined in a longitudinal study to determine the
          stability of our observation that CP in childhood, even when controlling for positive maternal bonding
          patterns, influences emotional reactivity patterns that predispose an individual to negative coping
          strategies, such as drug use, in adulthood, among low-income African American women.

        <p>The diversity of child social skills development is not well detected among Asian countries. Culturally
          validated assessments are needed for practitioners to evaluate child social skills. This study tested the
          measurement invariance of the Social Skill Scale (SSS) across Japanese and Chinese samples and explored
          country differences in child social skills development. The SSS utilizes a widely used factor structure
          (assertion, self-control, and cooperation subdomains) and has established Japanese and Chinese versions. We
          conducted investigations with an identical process and materials with different language versions,
          collecting data from 931 Japanese kindergarten children (Mage = 4.35, SDage = 1.07; 53.6% boys) and from
          1130 Chinese kindergarten children (Mage = 4.47, SDage = 1.00; 52.3% boys). We used multiple confirmatory
          factor analysis to test measurement invariance of the SSS and established the validity, reliability, and
          scalar measurement invariance for the first-order factor structure of the SSS across the two country
          samples. We also examined country differences on the associations between demographics, parenting practice,
          and child social skills development. We found that, compared to the Chinese sample, cooperation skills
          significantly increased more with age among the Japanese sample. However, <mark>spanking was negatively
            related to
            self-control skills development in both countries</mark>. Our findings contribute to the demonstration of

          anxiety problems and research has now begun to examine the links between parenting, parent anxiety
          sensitivity and their child's anxiety sensitivity. However, the extant literature has provided mixed
          findings as to whether parent anxiety sensitivity is associated with child anxiety sensitivity, with some
          evidence suggesting that other factors may influence the association. Theoretically, specific parenting
          behaviors may be important to the development of child anxiety sensitivity and also in understanding the
          association between parent and child anxiety sensitivity. In this study, 191 families (n = 255 children and
          adolescents aged 6-17 and their parents) completed measures of child anxiety sensitivity (CASI) and
          parenting (APQ-C), and parents completed measures of their own anxiety sensitivity (ASI) and their parenting
          (APQ-P). <mark>Corporal punishment was associated with child anxiety sensitivity</mark> and the child's report
          of their
          parent's positive parenting behaviors moderated the association between parent and child anxiety
          sensitivity. The child's gender was also found to moderate the association between parent and child anxiety
          sensitivity, such that there was a positive association between girls' and their parents anxiety sensitivity
          and a negative association in boys. The findings advance the understanding of child anxiety sensitivity by
          establishing a link with corporal punishment and by showing that the association between parent and child
          anxiety sensitivity may depend upon the parenting context and child's gender.</p>

        <h3>Individual differences in the development of early peer aggression: Integrating contributions of

        <p>This prospective longitudinal study focused on self-regulatory, social-cognitive, and parenting precursors
          of individual differences in children's peer-directed aggression at early school age. Participants were 199
          3-year-old boys and girls who were reassessed following the transition to kindergarten (5.5-6 years). Peer
          aggression was assessed in preschool and school settings using naturalistic observations and teacher
          reports. Children's self-regulation abilities and theory of mind understanding were assessed during a
          laboratory visit, and parenting risk (corporal punishment and low warmth/responsiveness) was assessed using
          interview-based and questionnaire measures. Individual differences in children's peer aggression were
          moderately stable across the preschool to school transition. Preschool-age children who manifested high
          levels of aggressive peer interactions also showed lower levels of self-regulation and theory of mind
          understanding, and experienced higher levels of adverse parenting than others. Our main finding was that
          <mark>early corporal punishment was associated with increased levels of peer aggression across the transition
            from
            preschool to school</mark>, as was the interaction between low maternal emotional support and children's
          early
          delays in theory of mind understanding. These data highlight the need for family-directed preventive efforts
          during the early preschool years.

        <h3>A longitudinal study of the role of children's altruism and forgiveness in the relation between parental

        <p>Using data collected over a 1-year period on a stratified random sample of 368 parents with children
          studying in nurseries (mean age=3.97years), this study assessed the predictive effects of parental corporal
          punishment, parental psychological aggression, preschoolers' altruism, and preschoolers' forgiveness on
          preschoolers' anxiety symptoms in Hong Kong, China. Results of hierarchical regression analyses showed that
          parental psychological aggression, preschoolers' altruism and preschoolers' forgiveness at Time 1
          significantly predicted preschoolers' anxiety at Time 2, when controlling for the initial level of
          preschoolers' anxiety and important demographic variables that co-vary with preschoolers' anxiety. Moreover,
          preschoolers' altruism moderated the predictive effect of parental psychological aggression on preschoolers'
          anxiety symptoms. The study has several significant contributions. First, <mark>the study supports the
            predictive
            effect of parental aggressive discipline on preschoolers' anxiety</mark>. Second, we provide evidence that
          preschoolers' altruism and forgiveness negatively predict preschoolers' anxiety symptoms. Third,
          preschoolers' altruism and forgiveness are shown to protect them against parental psychological aggression.
          A dual-focus approach to intervention and prevention is proposed to reduce aggressive discipline by parents
          as well as to enhance altruism and forgiveness in children. Parent training programs could be provided to
          teach parents positive discipline strategies. Home-based or school-based interventions could be designed for
          preschool children to foster and enhance their altruism and forgiveness.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Purpose: To determine the prevalence of corporal punishment and the infliction of injuries from a beating
          occurring without provocation in the previous 6 months among secondary school children in Hong Kong, and to
          examine the associations between these two forms of physical maltreatment with substance-use-related
          behaviors and attitudes.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: Using secondary data, a cross-sectional, self-administered, anonymous survey of 95,788 secondary
          school students was conducted in Hong Kong.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: The prevalence of physical maltreatment showed statistically significant associations with younger
          age, attendance in Chinese-speaking day schools, temporary housing, residence with only one parent, poorer
          parental relationship, greater peer influence, perceptions of excessive academic pressure, and feelings of
          being blamed for poor academic performance. <mark>Adolescents who had experienced corporal punishment were
            more
            likely to be current users of alcohol (OR = 1.11), tobacco (OR = 1.31), psychoactive substances (OR = 1.60),
            or heroin (OR = 1.90)</mark>. Those who had been beaten to injury by a family member without provocation
          within the
          past 6 months also were more likely to be current users of alcohol (OR = 1.35), tobacco (OR = 1.65),
          psychoactive substances (OR = 2.39), and heroin (OR = 3.07). Additionally, students who experienced physical
          maltreatment were more likely to be acquainted with habitual substance users, have better access to
          psychoactive substances, to have engaged in sex after abusing drugs, have obtained money from illegal
          sources to purchase drugs, and believe that psychoactive substances are not harmful or addictive.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusion: Physical maltreatment showed strong associations with drug-related behaviors and attitudes,
          after adjusting for potential confounders. Further longitudinal studies are required to understand the
          causal direction of the relationship.

        <p>Examined the hypothesis that distinct parenting practices may be associated with type and profile of a
          child's disruptive behavior problems (e.g., oppositional, aggressive, hyperactive). Parents of 631
          behaviorally disruptive children described the extent to which they experienced warm and involved
          interactions with their children and the extent to which their discipline strategies were inconsistent and
          punitive and involved spanking and physical aggression. As expected from a developmental perspective,
          parenting practices that included punitive interactions were associated with elevated rates of all child
          disruptive behavior problems. Low levels of warm involvement were particularly characteristic of parents of
          children who showed elevated levels of oppositional behaviors. <mark>Physically aggressive parenting was
            linked

        <p>Child maltreatment is an international public health problem. The aftermath can appear in multiple aspects
          of individual health and development, including decreased physical and emotional function, posttraumatic
          stress disorder (PTSD), and suicide attempts. However, there is lack of evidence regarding the quality of
          life of maltreated children. This study aims to examine the association between children's maltreatment
          experience and their quality of life. This study employed a cross-sectional design and surveyed 1,093
          primary school children (including migrant children and nonmigrant children) in Shanghai, China. The
          Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale (CTSPC) and Pediatrics Quality of Life Inventory were used to measure
          children's experiences of child maltreatment and their quality of life. <mark>Corporal punishment (89.47%) was
            the
            most prevalent form of child maltreatment</mark>, followed by physical assault (80.21%), psychological abuse
          (65.00%), and neglect (52.26%). Children's migration status was not associated with their quality of life;
          however, social capital factors were all associated with increased levels of quality of life. <mark>Children's
            victimization experience, including severe to very severe physical assault (β = -3.34/-3.80, p < .001),
              psychological assault (β=-3.74, p < .001), corporal punishment (β=-2.46, p < .01), and neglect (β=-4.31, p
              < .001), was associated with their decreased quality of life</mark>. The results show that child
              maltreatment
              threatens the quality of life of children. There is a need for developing effective interventions to
              prevent
              child maltreatment and reduce the adverse outcomes among children with maltreatment experiences.</p>

        <p>Behavioral problems impair children's health but prevalence rates are scarce and persistence rates vary due
          to divergence in age ranges, assessment methods and varying environmental factors. The aim of this study was
          to assess prevalence rates of behavioral problems, their persistence over a 1-year period, and the impact of
          child- and parent-related factors on behavioral problems. 555 2-6-year-old healthy preschool children were
          assessed at baseline and 382 of the initial sample at 1-year follow-up. Assessment included questionnaires
          concerning behavioral problems and their potential predictors (e.g. socio-economic status or parenting
          style). Altogether, nearly 7% of these children showed clinically relevant behavioral problems, and 3%
          showed persistent symptoms. Low SES, inconsistent parenting and <mark>corporal punishment were positively
            associated with behavioral problems</mark>. The prevalence rates of behavioral problems in Swiss
          preschoolers are

        <p>Objective: We sought to examine the relationship between perceived and stated parental expectations
          regarding adolescents' use of violence, parental use of physical punishment as discipline, and young
          adolescents' violence-related attitudes and involvement.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: Surveys were completed by 134 youth and their parents attending 8 pediatric practices. All youth
          were 10 to 15 years of age and had scored positive on a psychosocial screening test.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: Multivariate analyses revealed that perceived parental disapproval of the use of violence was
          associated with a more prosocial attitude toward interpersonal peer violence and a decreased likelihood of
          physical fighting by the youth. Parental report of whether they would advise their child to use violence in
          a conflict situation (stated parental expectations) was not associated with the adolescents' attitudes
          toward interpersonal peer violence, intentions to fight, physical fighting, bullying, or violence
          victimization. Parental use of <mark>corporal punishment as a disciplining method was inversely associated
            with a
            prosocial attitude toward interpersonal peer violence among the youth and positively correlated with youths'
            intentions to fight and fighting, bullying, and violence victimization</mark>.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusion: Perceived parental disapproval of the use of violence may be an important protective factor
          against youth involvement in violence, and parental use of physical punishment is associated with both
          violence perpetration and victimization among youth. Parents should be encouraged to clearly communicate to
          their children how to resolve conflicts without resorting to violence and to model these skills themselves
          by avoiding the use of physical punishment.

        <h3>The relationship of parenting style and eating behavior in preschool children.</h3>

        <p>Background: Eating behavior represents individual appetitive traits which are related to the individual's
          regulation of food intake. Eating behavior develops at an early age. There is some evidence that parenting
          styles might impact on the child's eating behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate the
          relationship of different dimensions of positive and negative parenting styles with the child's eating
          behavior at a critical age period of the child's early development.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: Parents of 511 preschool children (aged 2-6 years) completed the Children Eating Behavior
          Questionnaire and the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: Analyses revealed that different dimensions of negative parenting styles were associated with
          eating behavior of the child. In details, inconsistent parenting showed a consistent association with eating
          behavior of a child (i.e. higher emotional eating, higher food responsiveness, higher food fussiness, higher
          satiety responsiveness and more enjoyment of food), whereas <mark>corporal punishment was associated with more
            emotional overeating and more food responsiveness but less satiety responsiveness</mark>. Further, powerful
          implementation was related to higher food responsiveness and less enjoyment of food and low monitoring was
          associated with higher emotional overeating and more slowness in eating. There was no such consistent
          association of positive parenting and eating behavior.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusion: More negative parenting styles were associated with eating behavior which is more often related
          to potential weight problems in a long term, whereas positive parenting did not show such a consistent
          relationship with eating behavior. Negative parenting should be in the focus of prevention and treatment of
          eating behavior problems in young children.

        <p>Background: Epidemiological studies, describing both community and clinical samples of youth in need for
          psychiatric help, are rare in the middle east. To our knowledge, this is the first study that aims to
          investigate the demographic and clinical characteristics of a sample of children suffering from emotional
          and behavioral problems seeking psychiatric services in the Nile Delta region and the largest clinical
          sample to date in Egypt.
          <br>
          <br>
          Methods: The files of all new cases who presented for care in the outpatient service for children and
          adolescents between August 2016 and July 2018 were reviewed. Ninety-six files were excluded due to missing
          data while another 18 files were found to be for adults (ages > 18 years old), so the sample included 886
          cases.
          <br>
          <br>
          Results: The ages of our sample (n = 886) ranged from 18 months to 18 years with an average of 7.5 (± 3.8)
          years. Most of our cases were male, school aged children, living within low-income households and
          predominantly coming from rural areas. The most common diagnoses were attention deficit hyperactivity
          disorder (ADHD) (22.6%), intellectual disability (ID) (13.7%), depressive disorders (13.3%), and disruptive
          behavior disorders (DBD) (12.3%). Strong protective effects were found for family integrity and stability.
          <mark>Corporal punishment and physical and sexual abuse were noted to be significant risk factors for
            internalizing and externalizing disorders in children and adolescents</mark>.
          <br>
          <br>
          Conclusion: Except for males being a majority in our sample of children seeking psychiatric consultation,
          demographic patterns and prevalence of psychiatric disorders are comparable to other tertiary clinical
          samples in other parts of the world.

        <h3>Corporal punishment and violent behavior spectrum: A meta-analytic review.</h3>
        <p class="article-details">Link: <a
            href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1323784">https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1323784</a></p>
        <p>Corporal punishment is believed to precede various forms of violent behavior, yet prior research has
          yielded inconsistent findings, partly due to variations in violent types and other factors. This
          meta-analysis systematically reviewed 35 studies including 144 effect sizes (comprising a total sample size
          of 159,213) investigating the association between corporal punishment and a spectrum of violent behaviors
          called Violent Behavior Spectrum (VBS). Additionally, meta-regressions were conducted to explore the
          moderating impact of punishment severity, violence type and cultural context. Our findings indicated <mark>a
            significant positive relationship between corporal punishment and VBS</mark> (r = 0.238, 95%, CI [0.176,
          0.300]).
          Notably, punishment severity was found to influence the strength of this association. Namely, <mark>The more
            severe the corporal punishment, the more likely it is to lead to VBS</mark>. These results enhance our
          understanding of the intricate connection between corporal punishment and various forms of violence,
          providing valuable insights for both parenting practices and policy development.</p>

        <h3>What is the link between corporal punishment and child physical abuse?</h3>

        <p>This study aimed to contribute to the literature on corporal punishment by examining the link between
          spanking and child physical abuse. First, we examined the extent to which individuals who experienced spanking
          in childhood were at greater risk of also experiencing physical abuse by their parents. Second, we examined
          various parenting and family factors that could distinguish between spanking that occurred within and without
          a physically abusive context. A sample of 370 university students completed a questionnaire on disciplinary
          experiences at age 10. Results suggested that <mark>individuals who indicated having experienced spanking
            during
            childhood were at greater risk of also having experienced physical abuse</mark>. Among individuals who
          indicated
          having experienced spanking, greater spanking frequency, perceptions of impulsiveness in parental discipline,
          and reports of physical violence between parents significantly increased the risk of physical abuse. This
          research contributes to the growing evidence on the risks associated with child corporal punishment.</p>

        <p>A great deal of research has revealed a link between corporal punishment and negative life outcomes, but the
          underlying mechanisms that explain how and why these associations exist are not well understood. The current
          study extends this line of research by analyzing a longitudinal sample of high-risk male and female youth
          drawn from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being. The analyses revealed that the use of
          corporal punishment was differentially used depending on certain parental behavioral characteristics. Even
          after accounting for such attributes, our models generally demonstrated that <mark>corporal punishment was
            associated with later criminal involvement</mark>. The models also revealed that the corporal
          punishment-criminal
          involvement link was dependent upon the relationship of the parent to the child being spanked. Our analyses
          additionally address the importance of proper model specification when examining the association between
          corporal punishment and later life outcomes. We conclude by discussing implications for future research.</p>

        <h3>The relationship between grandparents' violent discipline and school bullying behavior among left-behind
          children.</h3>
        <p class="article-details">Link: <a

        <p>Most left-behind children in rural China are raised by their grandparents, whose parenting style
          significantly impacts children's development. This study examined the association between grandparents'
          violent discipline and left-behind children's school bullying. This cross-sectional study recruited a sample
          of 462 left-behind children aged 10 to 15 years old (Age Mean = 12.372, 49.351% girls) from four rural primary
          and junior high schools in Chongqing, China. There was <mark>a significant positive association between
            corporal
            punishment (β = .236, p < .001) and psychological aggression (β=.272, p < .001) of grandparents and
              children's school bullying</mark>. Empathy and moral disengagement mediate the above association.
              Cross-gender comparisons
              indicated that <mark>corporal punishment had a greater positive relationship with school bullying in
                boys</mark> than
              girls (βgirls=.154, p < .01; βboys=.250, p < .001). At the same time, boys' moral disengagement was also
                more likely to lead to school bullying (βgirls=.233, p < .001; βboys=.337, p < .001). We discuss the
                implications of these findings for preventing bullying in schools for children left behind.</p>

        <h3>Parental spanking of 1-year-old children and subsequent child protective services involvement.</h3>
        <p class="article-details">Link: <a

        <p>The majority of U.S. parents spank their children, often beginning when their children are very young. We
          examined families (N=2,788) who participated in a longitudinal community-based study of new births in urban
          areas. Prospective analyses examined whether spanking by the child's mother, father, or mother's current
          partner when the child was 1-year-old was associated with household CPS involvement between age 1 and age 5.
          Results indicated that 30% of 1-year-olds were spanked at least once in the past month. <mark>Spanking at age
            1 was
            associated with increased odds of subsequent CPS involvement</mark> (adjusted odds ratio=1.36, 95% CI [1.08,
          1.71], p
          <.01). When compared to non-spanked children, <mark>there was a 33% greater probability of subsequent CPS
            involvement for children who were spanked at age 1</mark>. Given the undesirable consequences of spanking
            children
            and a lack of empirical evidence to suggest positive effects of physical punishment, professionals who work
            with families should counsel parents not to spank infants and toddlers. For optimal benefits, efforts to
            educate parents regarding alternative forms of discipline should begin during the child's first year of
            life.

        <h3>Experience of parental corporal punishment in childhood and adolescence and its effect on punitiveness.</h3>

        <p>The family, as the primary instance of socialization, plays a key role in nurturing values and attitudes.
          Based on this notion, this paper looks at how parental corporal punishment in childhood and adolescence, as an
          expression of a strict, authoritarian upbringing, can influence punitiveness later in life. The results of a
          representative German sample using multivariate analyses show that <mark>individuals who were physically
            punished or
            abused by their parents during childhood or adolescence are more punitive than non-victims of parental
            violence</mark>. Based on these findings, the question of whether changing parenting styles might have
          implications
          at the macro-level of punitiveness is addressed.</p>

        <h3>Predictors of corporal punishment during the COVID-19 pandemic.</h3>

        <p>Although current policies discourage the use of corporal punishment (CP), its use is still widespread in the
          US. The objective of this study was to assess the proportion of parents who used CP during the pandemic and
          identify related risk and protective factors. We analyzed results of a nationwide cross-sectional internet
          panel survey of 9000 US caregivers who responded in three waves from November 2020 to July 2021. One in six
          respondents reported having spanked their child in the past week. <mark>Spanking was associated with intimate
          partner violence</mark> and the use of multiple discipline strategies and not significantly associated with region or
          racial self-identification. Parents who spanked sought out more kinds of support, suggesting an opportunity to
          reduce spanking through more effective parenting resources. Additionally, these results suggest that parents
          who report using CP may be at risk for concurrent domestic violence.</p>
